"neutral","Looks like the Nimbus 2000"
"negative","...did it jump to hyperspace? This looks faker than standard scifi effects"
"neutral","Eclipse class star destroyer sighted over Texas"
"neutral","Is that a super star destroyer?"
"negative","I don't know what to say other than it's some of the fakest shit I've ever seen. What's the context? When was it taken? Who took it? Why were they filming at that time? etc."
"neutral","This is giving me major CGI vibes..."
"positive","Princess Leia escaping in the nick of time..."
"neutral","I’m not defending this clip or anything but what if something so crazy looking happens that your brain automatically goes “Fake. Nope, that’s fake. Bye”. Lol."
"negative","Literally how a low IQ person would film pre-planning where to put the CG A real reaction would not have a steady pointed shot, and would actually look backwards to where the ship seemingly zoomed off to"
"neutral","This sub is still just as goofy as always I see."
"neutral","tom delonge is really just posting every single UFO clip he sees now lmao"
"neutral","I think the biggest issue with a video like this being released out into the wild by someone of at least some form of higher level on the subject, is that what video will it take for anyone to deem a video “believable” without question? It’s tough. Does it look real? IDK. Is the video quality slightly better than a potato? Yes, slightly. But it’s tough."
"negative","Seriously, this looks faked. Is there footage from other angles, other people? Something this large would have got attention."
"neutral","Just as soon as one person says it's fake everyone else agrees, does anyone ever have a worthwhile take other than its BS. I've yet to see A UFO video where everyone didn't slam the poster as a grifter. Are all these negative posters bots, or just just a herd of sheep??This video, could be the real deal and everyone just automatically says BS. What do you think a real alien space conveyance looks like?? Anyone have a take, or is it all BS?"
"positive","Thanks for the laugh. I needed one today."
"positive","Real/fake, that was dope!"
"neutral","has anyone done any sort of analysis to determine that it is in fact CGI, or does the magic power of incredulity make it so?"
"neutral","It looks like a UFO from this old artists depiction in an old book🤔 https://imgur.com/gallery/mZF5r9Q"
"negative","Welp, there goes the last bit of integrity. Meh, I don't know why I ever considered it might not end in bullshit like this."
"neutral","How is everyone so certain it’s cgi/fake?"
"neutral","Covenant battle cruiser"
"positive","Ludicrous speed!"
"neutral","It’s the destiny from stargate universe"
"neutral","finally the proof we need. All these years."
"neutral","No longer even bothering to make it look real. Just put ominous music"
"negative","People need to stop giving him a free pass."
"negative","The fake optic zoom really puts the cherry on top... Mwah!"
"negative","My God that's so fake looking"
"negative","That is fake as fuck"
"neutral","Imperial Ship-Confirmed"
"negative","This looks fake af"
"neutral","What’s his age again??"
"neutral","What class Star Destroyer is that?"
"neutral","The flash was a bit much"
"positive","This sub is comedy on a daily basis"
"neutral","I've seen a ship do the ""star trek"" jump before. It was just like out of the starting intro to ""The next generation"". I saw it completely stretch out and then vanish. That was like 20-25 years ago so I do believe this could be real."
"negative","Unless those lampposts are invisible I don’t know what to tell you. This is the worst vfx I have ever seen. Here’s an [obvious frame](https://ibb.co/Df4cbbV)"
"negative","What's the point of posting fake shit, if in fact this is fake? Is they're a benefit at all? The herd is going to call it all BS anyway. So why would someone make the effort to do that only to get knocked down.... It makes little sense."
"positive","That would be so bad-ass"
"negative","First thought: Fake. Second thought: Why my brain thinks it’s fake? In reality many things looks worse than CGI. Life is boring and dull and so can be warp ships. Tom don’t let us beg you and shed some light on the issue for less than 5000 bucks."
"neutral","I downloaded the video on request from the other post I made. Have you guys ever seen this one? Not sure what to make of it. Tom posted on Instagram 6 hours ago."
"positive","Cool! I hope this is real AF"
"negative","Damn Tom… you need better edit skills bro… fake AF"
"negative","Someone bought Aftereffects and discovered how to make really bad SFX"
"neutral","That looks quite similar to The Executor making the jump to light speed"
"neutral",">what is that oh it disappear LOL. Also, isn't that a star destroyer from Star Wars? Come on guys. NONE of this tracks. NONE of it."
"neutral","This guy could post the whole independence day movie and some ppl on here would eat it up as proof for extraterrestrial life."
"positive","After effects is fun..."
"negative","This community I swear"
