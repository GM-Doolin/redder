"Sentiment","Comment"
"negative","Looks extremely small"
"neutral","I really want the pilots take. I know one of our sub members pulled it from twitter, and I‚Äôm assuming not from the pilot himself, so I‚Äôm curious."
"positive","I did a short recording back and forth from the video: [https://imgur.com/a/seWVHB6](https://imgur.com/a/seWVHB6) It does make it clear that its something quite interesting (unless it is fake)"
"neutral","Looks like the same shape as the military video that was released. The one they were tracking and it was rotating."
"neutral","Flight of the Navigator"
"neutral","I mean its clearly your typical saucer shape tilted on its side giving of the manta vibe. I recall there is a theory from the navy footage the ufos flew tilted as opposed to traditional beliefs of flying level much like this ufo is seemingly doing so."
"neutral","Flight of the navigator"
"neutral","Does anyone know what year this is from? Where it was shot? Anything meaningful would be cool...."
"neutral","I did a small edit in slow motion with different exposures https://www.instagram.com/reel/CqsmstxOIn_/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y="
"neutral","What if, and hear me out, the aliens are controlling the balloons? Genius."
"neutral","This is a legit UFO we‚Äôre seeing here damn"
"neutral","Is there literally no context of who took this? Seems a rather important part of the situation. Looks like CGI when played."
"negative","If that‚Äôs anything manmade, then the person flying it should be in jail for operating it that recklessly near a manned aircraft"
"neutral","Dude this is a flying saucer üõ∏"
"negative","What the hell is this thing?"
"neutral","Looks a lot like the one seen over Sacramento about a year back from an ultralight airplane cruising. it also tilts at the end like this one does. [https://imgur.com/yySPHO1](https://imgur.com/yySPHO1) &#x200B; https://www.reddit.com/r/aliens/comments/10magj0/from\_ufotwitter/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3"
"positive","Ngl this is one of the more compelling pictures I‚Äôve seen of late. Also explains why it‚Äôs so hard to spot these because it‚Äôs small and goes at extreme speeds, hard to get a pic"
"neutral","Hmmm I remain skeptical but what catches my attention is that the exact same picture was featured as the thumbnail in one of astrum's recent videos on [UAPs](https://youtu.be/otPxviO_SCA). The video was uploaded two weeks ago but the source video (the one on the front page of the sub) is just gaining traction? I'm wondering just how old is this UAP video then???"
"neutral","Just looks like a balloon. Meh."
"neutral","Mylar balloons do all kinds of shape contortions in the higher atmosphere. They're tough and super light. I'm not going to say that doesn't look like a UFO, it does. But so can a mylar balloon if you leave it in the atmosphere long enough and catch it at just the right angle. We probably have to apply occams razor."
"neutral","Looks like it's flying belly first (if it's legit). Which fits Bob Lazar's story about the ""sports model"" craft. Also feels similar to one of the Navy videos that came from the east coast encounters."
"neutral","Flight of the Navigator! Compliance!"
"negative","Meh. Call me when we've got one of them on the ground."
"neutral","The thing is, it didnt behave like a balloon in the video. Its seen moving perpendicular to the pilot‚Äôs craft in the first few seconds, then as it exits the clouds in the far distance it makes a J shaped turn and accelerates out of those clouds and past the pilot very closely in a streamline. If the pilot saw it was a giant floating balloon, they‚Äôd report it as such and probably not fly right fn next to it risking their life for a gag. Let‚Äôs rule out balloon and keep passing along facts."
"neutral","Can we link the video in this post so we can easily compare?"
"positive","Bob lazar said they flew this way, belly forward in the direction of travel, if this is real, it's great footage for once."
"neutral","This photo is a clear image from a video shared in this sub, in which this object is seen from a flying airplane. Some propel has compared it to a ballon, although that particular model didn‚Äôt made it to commercial production"
"neutral","That sure as hell ain‚Äôt a balloon"
"neutral","Remember the Northrop commercial where they showed 3 or 4 prototypes? Looks similar to one of those. Saw it during a Superbowl like 5 yrs ago."
"positive","It reminds me of the ship from the movie Flight of The Navigator."
"neutral","That‚Äôs no balloon üéà‚Ä¶"
"neutral","Looks terrestrial"
"positive","I want to believe."
"negative","A pretty unclear image of whatever the fuck that is. I love this sub."
"neutral","Google Lens suggests it's a dolphin/whale."
"neutral","I don't believe anything without scale for reference"
"neutral","I'd like to bring some perspective on the size and distance of this object. It is a lot bigger and closer than what it appears on video. This is why the pilot was filming when it looked like nothing at the beginning. He was able to see it with his own eyes. Go outside and look at a tree then hold your smart phone camera at the tree. You'll see it looks smaller and further away."
"neutral","Is this the animal from the movie ‚ÄúNope‚Äù?"
"positive","With photoshop, all kinds of other editing softwares and tech in general, it‚Äôs hard to believe any photo is real, much less a ufo one. I believe there are other life forms out there, it would be stupid to believe we‚Äôre all alone. I just hope we‚Äôll get indisputable proof."
"negative","This is the stuff that pops out when China finally wants to declare war on the US, and we all see where that $800 billion a year goes lmao ü§£"
"negative","This is definitely man made. Why do people wish think the unlikely. Say some high tech creatures observe the part of space where the earth was a billion years ago before knowing that a lifeform was there, a billion years before the light of today would even reached that part of space. Why would they travel to a place with no signs of life? It is always more than likely a man made object."
"neutral","Is this a satire subreddit? An honest question."
"neutral","That thing is tiny, no one is inside it. It appeared to be moving very slowly if at all. Very balloon-y."
"positive","I've been a skeptical asshole in r/UFOs as of late, but this one....this one is different."
"positive","Most compelling video to date imo. Can‚Äôt stop viewing the video"
"negative","If it is a balloon... Then how the fuck is that balloon not being tossed or thrown by the planes wind wash? Why does it all of a sudden go stationary? What happened to the first one? Why is it so shiny? Why is it belly up? And why is this one at such a high altitude compared to the last UAP sightings and shoot downs?"
"neutral","Looks too small to me. Helium in an inflatable stingray or dolphin ?? https://www.discountleisureproducts.co.uk/images/intex-stingray-inflatable-ride-on-swimming-pool-toy-float-p2959-7348\_image.jpg"
"neutral","This is exactly what Bob Lazar described."
"positive","Another balloon, and people are freaking out again‚Ä¶ wtf is wrong with this sub üòÇ"
"neutral","Intriguing capture. Any further details of this incident?"
