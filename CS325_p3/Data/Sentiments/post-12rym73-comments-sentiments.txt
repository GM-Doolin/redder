"positive","This kind of thing is bittersweet for me every time. My grandfather was a massive UFO/UAP enthusiast and a former aerospace engineer and he passed about 10 years ago. Things like this have really ramped up since then and it hurts that he isn't here to see it. Every time there is incredible news like this I have a moment where I think how much I would love to share it with him. Y'all are a really great community, thanks for helping me keep his memory alive."
"negative","This was the only decent piece of information. Didn't press about the tic tacs, nothing on Puerto Rico, didn't press him on the other UAP that were shot down only the Chinese balloon. I was expecting more from the Senate"
"neutral","It's like the Mosul orb... now imagine all the footage the government has and we will never see"
"positive","I am always a 'negative Nancy' when it comes to things like these, but this is a half-decent video to be fair. This is exactly what we need. More pictures and videos like this. Longer ones preferably. This is why a lot of us are closely following proceedings - to see real data. We know they have plenty of it."
"negative","I mean, holy shit?"

"positive","lol in my head I imagine the operator being like ‚Äúwait wtf was that‚Äù a good second after it moves through fov of the drone, like a dog chasing a bird or something"
"positive","I am an skeptic but that looks very promising."
"neutral","Context: >Dr. Kirkpatrick: This is basically all the data we have associated with this event from some years ago. It is going to be virtually impossible to fully identify that, just based off of that video. Now what we can do, and what we are doing, is keeping that as part of that group of 52% to see what are the similarities, what are the trends across all of these, and do we see these in a particular distribution, do they all behave the same or not. As we get more data, we will be able to go back and look at these in a fuller context. How are we gonna get more data? We are working with the Joint Staff to issue guidance to all the services and commands that will then establish, what are the reporting requirements, the timeliness and all of the data that is required to be delivered to us, and retained, from all the associated sensors. That historically hasn't been the case, and it's been happenstance that data has been collected."
"positive","Dang. That's super good footage and it appears to be going pretty fast and steady."
"neutral","where is this? Iraq again?"
"positive","Wow. That‚Äôs kind of fucking cool. I guess it wasn‚Äôt s reflection in a puddle after all."
"positive","The technology, man... The technology this mf have. Just a ball that small not only capable of defy gravity, but go figure what's inside. Every possible sensor one can imagine and more?"
"neutral","Is this the same orb Jeremy Corbell released a photo of and everyone shit on him for it ?"
"neutral","I‚Äôm pretty sure I saw one of these. Just a metal ball sitting in the sky above the highway. My friend saw one too, sitting in the sky above her apartment. She took a pic but like all ufo pics, it doesn‚Äôt really look like much."

"neutral","Let‚Äôs see Mick West debunk this"
"neutral","Can‚Äôt wait for the balloon community to say something."
"positive","One of the best UFO videos of all time. What a shame they probably only showed a small clip, I bet the original was longer."
"neutral","That completely normal weather balloon is hauling incredible amounts of ass."
"neutral","What was the explanation for not having the entire video?"
"negative","So we got propulsion-less fucking spheres out here and we‚Äôre not dumping billions into finding out what the hell they are? I‚Äôm trying to ride on one of these!"
"neutral","Just a metallic orb. Tracking straight through the sky, without any discernable propulsion system."
"neutral","It looks like it zipped right over people who probably were completely unaware of it. Makes me wonder what has flown over me that I‚Äôve had no clue about."
"neutral","I hope that in 5 yrs, we'll see everything üôè"
"neutral","That looks like the drone from Star Wars that Luke uses to train his laser deflections"
"neutral","[deleted]"
"neutral","Any information on when and where this was taken?"
"positive","This is EXACTLY what I‚Äôve seen myself. The way it moves in a straight line, the way the light reflects off it, the size. Crazy."
"negative","Shits getting real"
"positive","The government finally released a video we can share with our families and not look like kooks"
"neutral","[deleted]"
"positive","This is exactly what I saw years ago Round Matte dark Grey Flying fairly low I never thought I'll see it again so clearly"
"positive","Everyone calling out Jeremy for being a fraud. Me included should now apologise. Dude was legit."
"positive","Must feel good to be Jeremy Corbell today. Good for him."
"positive","I saw this exact thing last year in Utah while on my back porch. It was a decently sized silver sphere that was traveling faster than anything we have. It was flying from North to south and wasn't that high in the air. I haven't seen a video of one of these so it's quite remarkable to me"
"positive","Now this is pod racing"
"neutral","[deleted]"
"positive","This is excellent."
"neutral","Ok so why did they STOP tracking it??"
"neutral","[deleted]"
"positive","Look at that! They learned how to blur the sensor information!"
"neutral","Wow, this one is crazy ! O_O"
"negative","My only issue is only three senators made the time to show up for the hearing. All of these politicians love making sound bites about the importance getting to the bottom of these anomalies, then don‚Äôt show up. When their questions and or influence could forward our understanding of the phenomenon. Regardless of the reasons for low attendance, it's essential for senators to fulfill their responsibilities as elected officials and actively participate in hearings related to anomalies or any other significant issue. Their presence, questions, and influence can contribute to a better understanding of the phenomenon and the development of effective solutions. As constituents, it's important to hold senators accountable for their attendance and engagement in hearings that impact the public interest. Engaging in constructive dialogue with senators and advocating for their active participation can help promote transparency, accountability, and progress in addressing important issues."
"neutral","It's extremely similar to the image Corbell & Knapp had on their podcast lately. Of course, not many people will actually give them any credit for it."
"positive","I‚Äôve seen things like these in person, up close, on three occasions! It‚Äôs absolutely crazy how these things just float and defy gravity. They move through air like reality is some virtual space. The ones I saw were orbs a little larger than a basket ball but smaller than a standard beach ball. Metallic and with an almost reflective sheen on it. No sound at all."
"neutral","Where are the balloon experts they‚Äôre who we need to consult with on this."
"neutral","I've seen those before. I live in Kansas near a rural path called Old Lawrence road. It's the main way to get between Wichita and the park city area. It was probably 2 a.m., but with my high beams, I saw 3 of those exact same metallic ball-shaped objects flying maybe 9 feet above the ground directly towards my truck at approximately 45 mph. My passenger saw it too. We stopped after they flew over us and got out of the truck. It's nearly pitch black out there. They aligned in some sort of formation and one by one darted into the sky at speeds I couldn't even estimate. No sound whatsoever (although there was a slight wind which could have covered the sound). They only emitted light once they took off into the sky."
"positive","Hope we get to see more things like these"
