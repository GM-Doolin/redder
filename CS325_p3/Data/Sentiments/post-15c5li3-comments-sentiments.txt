"positive","Bob Lazar is definitely someone I hope turns out to be vindicated. Will be really nice if we eventually all get to see these ships in great detail, and the physical ships actually line up with his descriptions exactly, or at least the *one* ship he was permitted to explore a bit in one portion of it."

"positive","The fun part is, if Bob was just full of beans, all these years, the Grusch story surely made him say, ""Whew! Saved by the bell!"""

"positive","This is satisfying as fuck"

"positive","Got to give it to him, he's waited 30 years to say this! Good for you, Bob! Thanks for being one of the OG ""whistleblowers"""

"neutral","He absolutely told us so. Specific clandestine locations, specific secret behaviors things about those locations, the fact that US had the tech, the fact that US was piloting it, etc... all corroborated slowly over the decades, and now eventually done so under oath. Certainly makes sense why he was attacked so egregiously."

"positive","Yeah Bob!! Good enough for me"

"neutral","My main question surrounding Mr Lazar is that if he was telling the truth, or potentially even making the whole thing up but randomly getting some hits too close to the ""truth"" , why did the PtB not just arrange for his silence?"

"positive","You’re goddamn right Bob"

"positive","I always believed Bob Lazar. From the first time I watched one of his interviews, I immediately noticed there's something up with this guy. He has clearly seen something. There's no way he's lying about everything. His story is too detailed."

"positive","This is actually pretty awesome"

"positive","Big ❤️ to Lazar."

"positive","This must probably be the most satisfying I told you so in history."

"neutral","I want to know what Grusch thinks of Bob. I would assume, if he has names and locations, he would likely know about the site that bob claimed to work at, if it was real"

"negative","Ugh, this is so stupid. Hey lets pull up a Weekly World News article from '98 about a guy getting abducted by aliens who looked like hot chicks that sucked his dick for ""science""....i mean aliens are real now, so everyone who ever told a story about them means it was all true, right? His schooling is a lie. His career is a lie. His claims are a lie. Period. Grusch saying his piece does not mean Bob Lazar wasn't full of shit; like it doesn't mean we now get to brush off shit like the ""advanced handscanner"" that was straight out of Close Encounters. That still happened. Why didn't *Lazar* go make his claims under oath? Why didn't *Lazar* name names and places? The guy is apparently a **first hand witness** to this stuff, he would be just as good as one of the people Grusch is listing.....so why is it so hard to put *him* on the stand?"

"positive","he's looking good."

"neutral","How do you not have a printed diploma from the college you graduated from."

"neutral","I told you so. Bob is a hero."

"positive","Yes!!!"

"negative","So are we just supposed to believe that the world's biggest secretive base, just let him Walz out with arguably (at the time) the rarest element on the face of the earth (stabilized moscovium) ? Cmon. The descriptions he gave, can easily be just him using pop fictions most used saucer. No one at MIT can ever remember him? What was his ""I told you so"" exactly ? Because I watched the entire hearing and nowhere in it did I think, huh, Bob was right."

"neutral","That Lazar is still seen as a credible figure after having exposed as being a fantasist embellishing/ fabricating education and employment is telling... He never showed anything and made a career of things. For independent minds who are not sheep and question things, UFO reddit and UFO Twitter are surprisingly laid back when it comes to the burden of proof from Lazar et al a way that they would never be if it was not about UFOs and they were the ones requiring evidence."

"neutral","i honestly feel that Lazar has been telling the truth all along. idk about john lear tho."

"neutral","I just wanna see the sport model"

"negative","If anything tangible comes from the ufo hearings, it still doesn’t vindicate Lazar. He would still be a fraud."

"neutral","I didn't catch it, was any evidence beyond anecdotal supplied?"

"negative","Did he ever get around to explaining why he lied about receiving two master’s degrees?"

"neutral","**obligatory link to bob lazar being thoroughly debunked** https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/oyxuok/bob_lazars_story_is_it_believable_here_is_some_of/ I swear if I hear someone say he “predicted” 115 one more time"

"negative","You mean the same guy who during his Rogan interview claimed about a headache when he was pressed on his knowledge, multiple times, and said he couldn't answer because of it? This group has become wow"

"positive","In the past few weeks I’ve binge watched/listened to hours and hours of interviews with Bob, John Lear, George Knapp and others in an effort to satisfy my scepticism over his story. I am now convinced he’s story is true. It is so consistent. If it were a lie, there is no way everyone’s story would line up. Where it does vary is where you would expect it to, like John Lears clear tendency to embellish everything not just regarding Bob. If you too would like to satisfy your scepticism, check this YouTube channel it has a wealth of Lazar contenthttps://youtube.com/@Lazarium"

"positive","Man this is crazy! What has been really fun lately, is to go back and read what people have said in the past and then apply to what is happening to today. The perspective change and correlations are freeing to say the least."

"positive","I don’t care what anybody says… I love me some Uncle Bob. Bout fuggin’ time!"

"neutral","Surprised it wasn't ""I have a migraine."""

"neutral","It think the post is relevant to everything going on. People are always asking where is Lazar? Why doesn’t he come out and say anything. Well he did and it was simple and sweet. Guess he feels he doesn’t owe us anything at this point. It’s a “stick up your…I told you so, now wait and see more comment”."

"neutral","Grusch’s allegations do not automatically vindicate Lazar. I maintain my deep skepticism due to Bob’s long documented shady past, uncorroborated claims, and bizarre refusal to prove his story by coming forward with element 115 or sitting down with any real scientific minds to discuss the world changing technology he claims to have worked on."

"neutral","Bob the goat"

"negative","But why did he have to lie about going to MIT? The outright lying is what did him in. It makes me wonder what else he's lying about?"

"positive","This made my day and then some! Thanks for sharing! Should we start a gofundme to make a statue of Bob? And where could/would it be placed?"

"positive","That's awesome, good for you Lazar. It's got to be a big weight off your shoulders. Nice work!"

"neutral","Aaaaanddddd... literally nothing has changed. Looking forward to the future, but.... nothing has changed."

"negative","Is anyone else bummed he didn’t testify? I really want to believe him but his lack of participation makes me doubt him."

"neutral","Oh, I thought he was gonna say he's having a headache"

"negative","The problem, Bob, is that ""you told us so"" using false credentials and completely unbacked claims that has set the UFO debate more backwards than it has forward. Hopefully Grusch is the real deal."

"negative","#GET PROBED, SKEPTICS"

"positive","Yeah!!!! &#x200B; Robert Lazar is a hero!!! Watch his original interview with George Knapp."

"negative","Rewatching a few of his interviews and I still don't find him honest. Nothing much to go with. This video is odd because the hearings does not mean lazar's talk is legit. Nothing from Lazar has any foundation."

"positive","Yip! he did tell us so! I do apologise Bob for doupting you!!!"

"neutral","Why is Lazar being pushed into the light again? What is his relevance to this? I understand he recieved a LOT of criticism from this community not even weeks ago. Why is he all of a sudden a hero?"

"neutral","Am i missing something? Did some official ufo announcement happen that proved anything? Or did some people answer questions and make statements without any tangible evidence?"

"negative","Personally I don't think any of this vindicated Bob or corroborated his story, I still don't believe him."

"negative","“Making news around the world”…except reddit will ban you for posting on ANY major sub."
