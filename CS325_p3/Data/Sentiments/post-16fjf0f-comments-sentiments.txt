"neutral","Maybe it‚Äôs their actual baggage, like each alien had one carry-on, and one personal item for under their seat"
"neutral","A ""different branch of the tech tree"" idea is speculated about in the short story The Road Not Taken. It's not a long read: https://eyeofmidas.com/scifi/Turtledove_RoadNotTaken.pdf"
"neutral","In this clip from [Jesse Michels‚Äô new interview with David Grusch](https://youtu.be/kRO5jOa06Qw?si=DbfkGXoURvVjakeS), Grusch explains that he wants to say the bare minimum to propel disclosure, citing that it is not his job to release the more important details. Grusch continues by saying ‚Äúsome baggage is coming‚Äù in relation to the non-human biologics he has previously mentioned."
"positive","My biggest take away came from the last few minutes of the full video. I believe he knows as much as anyone that‚Äôs ever been willing to talk about this stuff, and he seems‚Ä¶at peace, almost excited. I needed to see that, if I‚Äôm being honest."
"neutral","From the way he said I think he was hinting that for us to understand the biological aspect of that our whole paradigm of reality is going to have to change. We are going to have to accept that we are 100% being visited by creatures from another realm. Once that cat is out of the bag it is going to be hard to get back to our regularly scheduled programming"
"neutral","I wonder, if the NHI are extra terrestrials, if there‚Äôs an alien whistleblower on their planet talking about us in the same way our whistleblowers are talking about them? Or, perhaps they have achieved disclosure on their planet, and everyone knows about us humans."
"positive","Woah, I didn‚Äôt know there was a new DG interview. Will be watching promptly."
"neutral","Dude is trying SO hard not to slip up and say something"
"positive","love the tanline on the wrist, guy is an intelligence worker through and through, removes his watch when he‚Äôll be on camera"
"neutral","The baggage might mean we killed them, or they have integrated with human dna."
"neutral","Wait. You all are too casual about this. Did I miss something? Who is this interviewer? Why was he chosen? Is this Grusch doing what Cornell said he would?"
"positive","We just watched...I have to watch again. Him being on the spectrum answered some questions for me on the cadance of his speech, which I thought was odd. It actually gave him more credibility for several reasons to me. The point when they are discussing the frog in the faraday cage I couldnt tell if Grusch rolled his eyes or didnt know what the heck he , the host, was talking about"
"positive","David is looking relaxed and I'm kinda happy that he is in a good üòä place now. Glad that this is happening. Take my upvote!"
"negative","At this point, it's obvious humans are being portrayed as stupid and that we cant handle it. The sad part is that other humans decided this us for us"
"positive","Wow! The bizarre amount of negative comments here! I watched the whole interview, he struck me as a very balanced, level headed and trustworthy guy. All the comments here claiming otherwise, saying things like ""I don't trust his face"", ""obvious grift"" are just trying to plant seeds of distrust and create noise."
"positive","this whole video wasn't filled with a load of new info, but it was really nice seeing Grusch just hanging out and chatting and being himself. made me smile is all."
"neutral","My theory on the baggage: The (or some group of them) NHI are the custodians. They've helped guide our evolution and the evolution of this planet. That concept alone is pretty mind blowing, let alone the follow-up questions, like why or for what purpose."
"negative","To those of you saying he should say more; maybe you should listen to Corbell and Knapp more, even though you ridicule them too! If he says anything more than he's been approved to say by his lawyer(a literal former ICIG) and the pentagon in general, then he WILL get arrested, and his whistleblower status will be stripped from him. Just shut up and be patient.."
"neutral","With ""this baggage"", I wonder how much of this ties into our concepts of self or even life/existence. Something like life/death or consciousness are not as we'd initially assume/expect, or that we ourselves are derived physiologically from these biologics, would only be the kind of thing that would really upend human society in a substantial way - e.g. refuting established religious dogma akin to the Copernican model/Darwin and Evolution. Exciting times we live in lads."
"positive","Holy shit that was a great two hours."
"neutral","‚ÄúSome baggage‚Äù I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs ‚Äúsome baggage‚Äù that comes with auditing the Pentagon‚Äôs financials too, doesn‚Äôt mean it shouldn‚Äôt happen immediately or as soon as possible."
"positive","Currently watching and im loving it. Glad to see Grusch back"
"neutral","I wonder if the baggage from the biologics is something relating to how in America (and most of the world) we're an individualist society and these beings are likely more of a collective society, they are probably going to tell us we need to change and it's more of a demand than a question, but who knows"
"neutral","Does this mean there will be more hearings or possibly announcements? Would be cool to see them doing offical press briefings on this stuff."
"negative","Ive rarely seen so many comments about a persons looks. Seems Like the us gov. And their Lemmings are spending Work time in Reddit again."
"neutral","I read it as ""it's not stored in a Indiana Jones warehouse sitting in a crate"" but actually stored and researched within corporations that would have some explaining to do aswell about their connections to deep government and taxpayer funding while withholding potential world saving tech/biologics"
"negative","Man they are coming out of the woodworks to talk shit about him. Imagine if your job was to talk shit about an exemplary example of a human being on Reddit? Pathetic. Edit: thanks for proving my point comments below‚Ä¶."
"negative","This sub is compromised"
"neutral","Grusch clarified something that's been bugging me for a while: ""Why he can say some specific things and not others"". It turns out that those specific things is what he submitted for DOPSR review. He might get clearance to discuss other things, but he would need to submit a new DOPSR, but he said is not his job to disclose everything. He just gave away the important stuff as a starting point. Makes sense."
"positive","These comments do not pass the vibe check. If you‚Äôve got nothing nice to say, maybe you should shut your mouth and divest yourself of the topic. I‚Äôm not saying this to those who are critical and ask questions, but those who are outright attacking him personally for his appearance or no good reason. Comments talking about his weight and character are utter garbage and should be shamed."
"neutral","The baggage is that the bodies contain human DNA, mixed with something else that's going to be ""sobering"" and its going to also introduce some questions about what it means to be human. Its also going to be an interesting discussion about how we get a mixed breed being! That's the baggage"
"neutral","By baggage I think he means the stigma and ridicule that would come with something like saying ""non human biologics."""
"negative","Wait till the baggage comes out of the bag that we've never been alone and this has long been a colony"
"positive","Watched half before bed. Can't wait to watch the other half. I'm one of the believers who wants to see the evidence, but this interview (so far) is great. Even though he hasn't released new information or evidence I'm really enjoying him just talking about what he's already mentioned. But I'm really enjoying the extra theories that he goes through with the atom and bombs, different technological pathways taken."
"positive","I‚Äôm so glad to see him looking well and speaking out more!"
"negative","""Sort by New"" and be baffled by the amount of trash comments/bots that are operating in this thread ATM. Jesus."
"neutral","Just here with üçø"
"negative","The ""baggage"" related to biological could be we've been cloning and killing aliens for years as part of the reverse engineering process...and giving them access to human ""biologicals"" as well...an eye for an eye."
"neutral","His thoughts on the warp drive is interesting. There must be some vehicle debri or intact craft he is aware of that is shaped similar to a 'biblically accurate' ""Throne."" Those things that possibly took that plane looked as if they could rapidly bend space around them as needed. This NHI surely has multiple kinds of entry vehicles into our dimension..."
"neutral","Only thing I think it can be is shared DNA. Anything Beyond that feels like it requires mind melding or telepathy or something‚Ä¶ That NHI shares our DNA will be fucked up, and it‚Äôs also something that we can probably reliability figure out"
"positive","The really important part is that it has gotten nearly half a million views in 17 hours. Keeping this in the minds of the population is the most important thing any interview can do."
"neutral","Grusch is built like a TANK lol. How tall is he? At least 6 foot 4 and 250 lbs I think."
"negative","Wow, whoever is mobilizing all these bots to bash Grusch is doing a horrible job. It must just be some troll, I refuse to believe the USG is this incompetent."
"positive","It was much better than the News Nation interview, even if there wasn‚Äôt that much new info. I hope we can find the truth to this mistery in our lifetimes."
"negative","No idea about the contents of this interview but the video confirms a comment I said months ago - I hope those threatening Grusch are armed because he's an absolute unit and I imagine could fuck some cunts up if need be."
"neutral","Biggest things I learned: NHI = sentient beings with body‚Äôs and minds, and they are what we would call pilots (so can the trolls stop saying it is bacteria or dead cows or whatever the hell lol) Also, ‚Äúontological shock‚Äù is in regards to ‚Äúwhat happens after death and are we alone in the universe‚Äù and religion was a part of why the oldguard MIC hid things"
"neutral","Can we watch the unedited interviews somewhere? I'd like to hear what Grusch has to say without constant interruption."
"neutral","Just like Corbell said, Grusch was about to be unmuzzled and we may get information in other ways besides hearings."
"neutral","The way he talked about Oppenheimer has me thinking that MJ-12 might be confirmed."
"positive","God bless David Grusch."
