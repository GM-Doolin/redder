Things like this have really ramped up since then and it hurts that he isn't here to see it.

As we get more data, we will be able to go back and look at these in a fuller context. How are we gonna get more data? We are working with the Joint Staff to issue guidance to all the services and commands that will then establish, what are the reporting requirements, the timeliness and all of the data that is required to be delivered to us, and retained, from all the associated sensors. That historically hasn't been the case, and it's been happenstance that data has been collected."

Regardless of the reasons for low attendance, it's essential for senators to fulfill their responsibilities as elected officials and actively participate in hearings related to anomalies or any other significant issue. Their presence, questions, and influence can contribute to a better understanding of the phenomenon and the development of effective solutions. As constituents, it's important to hold senators accountable for their attendance and engagement in hearings that impact the public interest. Engaging in constructive dialogue with senators and advocating for their active participation can help promote transparency, accountability, and progress in addressing important issues."

My passenger saw it too. We stopped after they flew over us and got out of the truck. It's nearly pitch black out there. They aligned in some sort of formation and one by one darted into the sky at speeds I couldn't even estimate.

The field back there was empty at that time (june 2011) now its filled with houses. Anyways, they came up above the treeline, one at a time, at about 5ft above the tree, it made a 90 degree pivot toward the direction we were, which was right in front of it. Then a few feet towards out direction and the next one popped up and did the same thing. This happened 7 more times (9 orbs in all) and followed each other in a perfect line. They came up the hill we had just gone down and was now stopped at the bottom of, always staying about 5ft above the treeline. So im assuming the trees were 45 ft tall, im probably way off because idk how tall tree normally are lol. And just went over us, but about 10 ft to the left more than right over us. They looked to be about the size of a tiny car like an old beetle or a smartcar, they had no noise, nothing i could see that propelled them, and when the sun hit them at one point, they shown like silver metal. Literally just looked like 9 car sized metal marbles or ball bearings, floating in the sky. I was with my ex and our son and there was a red car stopped behind us that got out of the car and stood watching. I was terrified and hysterical, and my ex was just chill about it like it didnt bother him."

While I feel the Pentagon would have no problem hiding details from us, they have done it for over 70 years after all, they would not produce a 'fake' video for the hearing. I think this is probably something they felt they could release without causing that much of a stir. They had to produce something, and it could not be like that last ridiculous video of a dot for 2 frames. I think they have MUCH better content available, and we will not see it. But c'mon.. this was taken with a Reaper, the top of the line surveillance equipment with multiple sensors and radar. I don't believe their 'this is all we have for the event' comment either, not for a second. They would not release a video that has probably been examined by experts, captured by the highest end equipment available in a drone for the hearing if they knew it was a balloon. It's hilarious how the armchair Reddit experts already KNOW what it is. And of course, they have already produced a few different, but 100% certain scenarios. It's a falling object. It's a balloon. It's parallax. C'mon... I doubt 90% of those commenting on parallax had even heard of it until Mick came along. I think there is much better stuff we will never see unless Congress tightens the Pentagon's budget drawstrings.. and that will not happen. There are not enough people in Congress who care or even know about UAP for that to ever happen. We need a Snowden level event, where someone spills all the goods, that is probably the only way we will ever really find out."

But I think the rest of what they showed was clear indication that they\u2019re being intentionally shifty. 1.They gave a breakdown of shapes, and 52% are spheres. 2.They provided a list of features which leave a lot to be desired. Speeds from Stationary to Mach 2. Either one of those extremes eliminates balloons. The question that they didn\u2019t answer and needed to was how many of *those* specific objects were spheres. 2.Then we get this sphere video. What I find very curious is that Jeremy Corbell released better footage of what by all appearances is the same or an identical object from the same area. Considering that footage came from the military, AARO should have it. That means they\u2019re intentionally only releasing videos that make the determination of what it is more ambiguous. In the video they released the few pixels could easily be explained away as a Mylar balloon. In the one Corbell released people were claiming it was a puddle, because it didn\u2019t display any features of a typical Mylar balloon (no seams, perfectly round, non-reflective). No smoking gun that this sphere is a UAP, but the fact that they categorized it as such and chose to display it is not random and needs to be considered. The Disclosure crowd keep saying that the USG \u201cknows\u201d these things are ET, and yet AARO keeps kicking the can down the road. Either they\u2019re getting directed to cover the whole thing up, or they\u2019re trying to ease the public into this as slowly as possible. Place your bets. Edit: I admit I haven\u2019t been able to watch the heating (yet), I\u2019m only going off what I\u2019ve seen discussed online."

If you do some basic Pythagorean math, the reaper would have to have travelled 7.62 km in 17s, that\u2019s equivalent of Mach 1.31. I doubt that a reaper w/ a prop can do that. If the ball elevation was lower you would have even bigger issues, and if you use arc angle for calculations, the distance travelled would be even greater. And if the distance travelled by the ball was greater, the speed of the drone would have to increase as well. Sure, there may be fumble effects, but not that dramatic. Edit: what I\u2019m saying is that parallax is highly improbable"

            "body": "The fastest human spacecraft (Parker solar probe) is expected to reach a speed of 430,000 mph. Alpha Centauri is 25 trillion miles away. If aliens had a spacecraft capable of moving 10x that speed, it would take them 600 years to reach Earth. If they could travel 100x faster, it would take them 60 years. First, they'd have to have any good reason at all to spend the resources required of such a mission to travel to this particular solar system. Which if they're from Alpha Centauri, isn't too far fetched. But if they're capable of that journey, then there's just not any point in worrying, or doing anything at all, because there's just no way we could do anything to them. I think aliens exist. The universe is so big, it would seem completely improbable there isn't life elsewhere. I'm not at all sure that it's likely other life would have evolved in the particular way that humans have, that led us to develop spacecraft. That outcome could very well be exceedingly rare. T biggest issue I have with the idea of any aliens/tech visiting Earth (unless they're somehow local), is that space is incomprehensibly huge, and everything is so fucking far apart. Inter-star system travel would just take so fucking long, no matter how fast you were going, that I'll always be skeptical of the hundreds of pieces of usually shitty \"UFO\" footage (this clip is pretty good though). But man I wish we confirm alien life before I die. I'd be ecstatic with a single celled organism on Europa. I'd shit myself if we found a spacecraft, or any piece of technology that we cannot account for. That's that good evidence that I'd probably require to change my view."

The analysis concluded in 2012 claims it's just a ball check valve that fell off a scrap artists vehicle. How interesting. \"On March 27, 1974, the Betz family investigated a small brush fire near their residence in Ft. George Island, Florida.[2] The family of three, Antoine, Jerri, and son Terry, came across a small metal sphere the size of a bowling ball. Their first thought was the sphere had been a cannonball left from New World conquistadors. They decided to take the sphere back to their house.[3] Several days later, Terry was playing the guitar in their home. The sphere seemed to react to the sound of the guitar. It made a throbbing noise. Later, the sphere was noticed to roll on its own and even stop on its own and change direction. Terry started doing experiments with the sphere. He noticed the sphere would reverberate when hit with a hammer. He also found the sphere would move after being shaken and placed on the ground.[4] The Betzes reported that the sphere moved on its own several times, and that it would follow people around the house seemingly on its own. Eventually, they stored the sphere in a trunk, and only took it out to show friends and family.\""

And the ground seems to be moving super fast which must mean the object is moving at the same speed right? Except, if the object was closer to the camera, that would explain how it would struggle to keep it in frame while making the ground appear to be moving fast. That means, the object can actually be moving a lot slower than it looks. I just tried this with my phone and a super unscientific test, but yes, the background moves faster when you're following an object close to the lens. I think it's just a balloon, moving at a regular speed. We're just thrown off due to the wonky perspective and lack of depth of vision. e: I read a lot of posts suggesting alien surveillance drones, but why would advanced tech need to surveil at a far lower altitude than our old tech."

If you have a slower moving object and a high altitude object filming it, the speed of the higher object would make the lower object seem to move faster. Ok.. I get that. I don't get how it flies over multiple home, streets and fields in 17 seconds. If were moving say.. a few MPH, parallax would make it seem very small very quickly, right? It looks the same size throughout, and it doesn't look like the camera is zooming in to make it bigger, ground objects remain the same size throughout. It certainly would not look like it was flying over anything.. because it hasn't. So what are people suggesting.. it is incredibly windy and parallax combined? Hmm.. sus. Especially as it doesn't waver. Objects on the wind tend to move with the wind, which rarely moves in a straight line. If someone who understand parallax better than I apparently do could explain it, I would appreciate it!"

And most people either don\u2019t know or don\u2019t believe we\u2019re getting visitors from outer space. So, if our military pisses them off, our whole planet of people could probably all be wiped out in one fell swoop! We don\u2019t know what kind of weaponry they have, but we know they could exterminate us like a bunch of cockroaches and still preserve the land. Just look at Mars. It appears that it had big cities, buildings, homes, water in lakes, ponds and streams, and now it appears to have been wiped out by nuclear weaponry, destroying everything and ruining the planet, maybe thousands of years ago. So, how far do you think the aliens have advanced since then? But I don\u2019t think they\u2019d wipe out the Earth; just us \u201chostile\u201d people. It\u2019s really stupid that we\u2019re kept in the dark by our own govt and military, except for those wonderful whistleblowers! Without them we\u2019d know even less than we know now.

In the sky its easy, but ground is a whole other level because the object would always move slighty with the camera since the object is edited into the video). But this one is absolutely authentic. Nothing at all speaks for CGI. The source of it and everything else speaks even absolutely against CGI. This video is a gem for the UFO community. We see a damn flying metal ball with fast speed, no wings and no propulsion. What kind of crazy tech this must be... how do they fit all that anti gravity tech into that small bowling ball..."

The man made part is my own opinion based off the fact that no scientific agency has stated life capable of developing advanced flight systems has been found outside of Earthly origins.

The rational train of thought is to imagine that they travel through our perceived reality (or dimensions) to get to us, which is space-time. But what if there are other realities that exist aside from space-time. Imagine an intelligence that has evolved from pure consciousness over billions of years and exists outside of our known framework, poking its head into different times whenever it wants. Space-time engineers. An amorphous hive mind that exists outside of our universe, with the ability to manifest physical, technological, appendages that study the lesser dimensions. I like to imagine that, if a life form evolves long enough under the right conditions, it reaches a singularity where biology, consciousness, and technology intertwine. Then continues to evolve. The known universe is old. Pure speculation but the deeper you get the crazier and harder to understand this becomes."

No lights or anything, didn\u2019t change shape or do anything weird, but the *zipping* along is exactly, exactly the same. It\u2019s what made the whole thing so weird. It was broad daylight. I\u2019m intentionally not engaging with the pro balloon people directly, bc believe it or not, I\u2019m the dope who likes to watch balloons float away since it\u2019s almost poetic. I like watching them dance around and I kind of root for them to make it out of the power lines and buildings and trees without bursting. I know this was not a balloon. However, I\u2019m not remotely interested in debating the physics of this, since all I really have is a kind of lame firsthand experience when I stepping outside for a computer screen break from my job. If I had to describe the size, I\u2019d say more of a shotput ball. Cannonball at most? Because it didn\u2019t float, but was more _driven_, my memory associates it with something heftier. I would not have wanted to collide with that thing. But then again, I struggled to gauge the size because there was something so inconsistent with its speed with respect to where I perceived it to be in the sky. Do you know what I mean?"

I was out having a smoke and enjoyed the clear night, just watching the stars.Then I saw one light that was moving. It had a slightly curved, downwards facing path. At first I thought it was a shooting star. But those burn up quickly. Satellites usually have much straighter paths and air crafts blink. This was just a steady light source. After watching it for half a minute or so it stopped. It was still shining just as bright and with a steady shine. It remained motionless for like 5-10 seconds, then darted across the night sky in incredible speed, going in a straight line. It never blinked, but what's even more strange is that it didn't accelerated. It went from 0 to inhuman speed in an instant. A few seconds later it was out of sight. No sound could be heard. I have no explanation for this. No human could have made something that moves like that with our current tech. It went from 0 to what must have been at least mach-5 in a fraction of a second. Still freaks me out thinking about it"

I\u2019m not opposed or dismissive of it and sometimes I wonder if that\u2019s the case, but how would you counter the evolutionary standpoint of our consciousness being the natural byproduct of our senses that developed as survival mechanisms? If the theory of evolution is accurate, that would mean our tools for physical perception (the 5 senses) had a beneficial purpose probably for obvious reasons from an evolutionary point of view\u2026if you follow that logic, you can assume that the 5 senses allowed us to interpret the world on a cognitive/biological level, which then expanded into our ability to analyze and perceive on a deeper level (basic intelligence) which finally allowed us to recognize a self\u2026aka consciousness. I think your way of looking at this is way more \u2018optimistic\u2019 since it would guarantee something more being out there whereas the one I\u2019m discussing is a lot bleaker as it would indicate a \u2018nothingness\u2019 to the meaning of our existence and that everything truly is just by chance\u2026which is quite mind blowing as well if you think about it\u2026anyways as you can imagine I should probably get some sleep lol"

Title 10 refers to the US laws governing the military, 50 governs the intelligence community. Part of Title 10 is a general prohibition from gathering or using intel inside the United States. Exceptions are made for training or in very specific circumstances (FISA, search & rescue/disaster relief, etc). They need Title 50 authority to gather domestic intelligence. That's why all their intel comes from overseas or in training ranges. Source: I was in an intel squadron in the air force and we had to be familiar with these laws."

I'm not saying it is 100% a balloon, but saying you can totally rule it out is just silly."

Not sure what category I would fit into now (if any), I just have the opinion that existence is a very clever design, and that some form of intelligence is responsible for it. Reddit only allows so many characters, before which it won't allow me to post, so I'll condense it as much as possible. My guess (and it's only a guess) is that the Body, Brain and Central Nervous system your consciousness inhabits is just an Avatar, your Avatar itself... inhabiting a very clever simulation, some of which simulated by your own consciousness. I think of it this way... 1. Body, Brain and Central Nervous system = A Computer. The body being the base unit (like a PC tower), the peritoneum and ligaments like the motherboard the organs attach to, and the central nervous system being the connections and censors. The Brain is like the CPU, the heart is like the PSU etc.2. DNA = The code required to build the computer. DNA basically instructs amino acids to form amino chains, the chains are then strung together to build 3-dimensional functional protein molecules that become you and I.3. The Operator = That's you, and anyone else reading this. A computer is useless without an operating system. And a computer with an operating system is useless without an operator.4. The operator is your conscious soul. Consciousness 'is' your soul. I don't dispute Evolution at all, I know it's true. Despite it being classified as a theory, in scientific terms it's solid. 1. Scientific Hypothesis = Educated guess.2. Scientific Theory = Overwhelming evidence with nothing coming remotely close to disproving it.3. Scientific Law = Proven4. Gravity is a theory, but I don't see anyone willing to jump out a tall building in an attempt to prove the word theory is weak, do you?5. That\u2019s because the word theory (in science) doesn\u2019t mean what most people think it does. A theory in science isn\u2019t really a guess, rather a carefully painstakingly researched, well-constructed, evidenced based story.6. Gravity is true. Evolution is true... it's just incomplete, neither theory is weakening, it's only strengthening overtime as human learn new things.7. Life comes before Evolution, and DNA comes before life. Evolution is what happens after life has begun. DNA is the most incredibly complex biological computer code in existence.8. Every word, letter, number, every piece of data humans have in existence, every invention, language, discovery, absolutely all information humans have\u2026 could fit into a single teaspoon of DNA.9. The odds of DNA forming by random chance is 1 in 10 to the power of 90,000. That\u2019s a 1 with 90 thousand zeros on the end of it.10. The number of atoms in the universe is estimated to be between 10 to the power of 78 and 10 to the power of 82. That\u2019s a 1 with only 78 zeros on the end of it, to a 1 with only 82 zeros on the end of it. Even if we assume it\u2019s the higher estimate of 10 to the power of 82\u2026 that means there are not enough atoms in the universe to facilitate the mathematical odds of DNA forming by random chance\u2026 10 to the power of 1 with 90 thousand zeros on the end of it.11. So even with the vastness of the universe with it\u2019s 1 septillion stars and planets. (10 to the power of 24) \u2026 there are not enough atoms to mathematically facilitate the odds of DNA forming by random chance. Something intelligent did it. Doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a god, but it\u2019s not by random chance. I'll continue this on the next reply, as I suspect it might be getting too long for reddit."

            "body": "Back to the senses. Lets break it down\u2026 1.I\u2019ll start with touch as I\u2019m touching this keyboard to type this reply to you. Oops, no I\u2019m not. Despite me seeing, feeling and hearing that I\u2019m tapping these keys, all of it is a complete illusion of my own consciousness mind. How so? Well at the sub atomic particle level (meaning sub atom, smaller than an atom) inside the atom, there are Electrons\u2026 those electrons have negatively charged casings. So, the atoms inside my fingers, and the atoms inside the keys of this keyboard both contain electrons with negatively charged casings\u2026 think of a magnet, when you try to push two magnets of the same polarity together\u2026 what happens? They repel each other. Two poles of the same polarity repel each other. So, at the sub atomic particle level, nothing ever touches, this means touch is literally impossible. What we experience is our nerve endings detecting this repulsive force, which then go on to send signals to our \\*consciousness\\* which then simulates the illusion of touch using our physical brains, with our brains being part of the avatar our conscious soul inhabits. 2. Sight\u2026 I can see my fingers touching the keys, right? What is sight? Sight is the collection of Massless, Weightless, Colourless and Formless, invisible light photons by the retina of the eye. The retina then sends signals to my \\*consciousness\\* which them simulates the colour and form of what I\u2019m looking at. Think of it this way\u2026 think of a room with a single table in the centre of it, on the table is a burning candle\u2026 what colour is the flame? You\u2019re probably thinking yellow/amber. Now imagine you\u2019re not in the room, a spider walks into the same room after you\u2026 what colour is the flame now? The spider see\u2019s Green/Ultra violet. So who\u2019s seeing/saw the true objective colour and form? You or the Spider? The answer is neither you, nor the spider\u2026 the flame has no colour or form until Consciousness simulates it. The light photons enter your retina, a signal is sent to your \\*consciousness\\* and that consciousness simulates the illusion of the colour and form you experience using your brain. Without consciousness, the brain can't simulate the illusion of sight. Consciousness is an essential component of the subjective simulation created by your own consciousness. The colour and form would not exist without consciousness existing first. It is a subjective illusion, not objective reality. 3.Hearing\u2026 I can hear my fingers tapping the keys, so it must be real right? What is sound? Soundwaves are completely silent. They make Zero sound. They are silent puffs of air. Without consciousness, sound does not exist. How so? If a tree falls in an empty forest, with no life around to hear it, does it make a sound? The answer is no, the tree falls completely silent in the empty forest. How so? The silent, invisible soundwaves have no consciousness present to simulate the illusion of sound. The silent, invisible sound waves enter the ear, they hit the basilar membrane, tiny hairs vibrate, sending an electrical signal to our consciousness, and our consciousness converts the signals from the totally silent, invisible soundwaves into the illusion of sound. So if the tree falls in an empty forrest with no conscious life around to hear it, the tree falls completely silently. Since sound does not objectively exist. 4.So, I\u2019m not touching these keys, the sight of me touching these keys is nothing but a simulation of my own consciousness, as is the sound of my fingers striking the keys. It\u2019s not real. It\u2019s not objective reality, it\u2019s subjective to the concious evolution of my species, subjective to this avatar my consciousness inhabits. Other species see, hear and feel what I think I\u2019m experiencing totally different to me. But my reality is no more real than there\u2019s. My reality, and your reality is a subjective illusion of our own consciousness. So what is real? The only thing that's real, is that our existence, and the existence of all living things, is a simulation, and a simulation can not happen without a simulator... an intelligence of some sort. 5.Smell and taste are simple\u2026 chemical reactions, again subjective to the species, not objective reality. In quantum mechanics\u2026 There is something called the observer effect, where the conscious observer appears to be able to influence the location of sub atomic particles simply be observing the experiment. And that the wave function breaks down only with the act of conscious measurement. It seems, the Universe is conscious, and we are part of its conscious existence. The Universe can\u2019t exist in the form we subjectively simulate it, without the existence of our consciousness. And we can not exist without the existence of the Universal consciousness. The same goes for all other conscious living beings. And since our consciousness can influence the location of sub atomic particles which we believe to be separate to us, which we believe to be outside of us... then our consciousness probably isn't confined to our avatar... our brain body and central nervous system. It seems that consciousness is probably a form of energy that humans don't yet understand. If we consider Thermodynamics and the Law of the Conservation of Energy... in that \"Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, however energy can change forms and move from one place to another, but the total energy in an isolated system remains constant.\" Then if consciousness is a form of energy inside a simulated reality, and that simulated reality has an intelligent simulator, an intelligence source... then consciousness can probably change forms, and move from one place to another... i.e, it's probably not confined to the Brain, Body and Central Nervous system. Nor is it simply the sum of the electrical signals sent through the Central Nervous System, since a dead brain can't simulate anything, consciousness must reside in the brain, or the CPU of the computer has no operator. The operator is somewhere else, since the brain, body and central nervous system is not an isolated system."

I hope it's not the case, and that any society capable of working together enough to invent interstellar travel wouldn't be hostile, but we just have no idea. The thing we need to keep in mind when it comes to aliens, is that they're almost certainly going to be weirder and more inexplicable than we expect. Them looking at us, and or studying us, is probably akin to us shouting at an anthill knowing that almost everything we're presenting them with is far beyond anything they can begin to understand. And that's OK, we'll get there eventually. For now I'm just glad they haven't revealed themselves and killed us all, or made or slaves, or whatever.

I don't know how far the object is from the camera relative to how far the object is to the ground. The halfway point was just an example. No one can make an accurate determination of how far away it is, and thus cannot make an accurate determination of how fast it is going.

It's hard/impossible to tell the specifics from this video, which is probably why AARO doesn't want to make a conclusive statement, instead leaving it categorized as \"unidentified\". And assuming their criteria for categorization doesn't change, it will literally always be in the \"unidentified\" category, because there is simply not enough information available to make a more conclusive determination. But being categorized as unidentified doesn't mean it isn't a balloon. It could be entirely consistent with a balloon and still remain categorized as \"unidentified\"."

There's a group that's trying to get to the bottom of this, believing that scientists are actually being targeted and manipulated by some person or group of people. And also there is a strange virtual reality game called Three Body where players must survive by learning how to predict fluctuating eras of stability and chaos where entire civilizations can be wiped out due to extreme cold or extreme heat that can fluctuate within minutes. Players in the game must \"dehydrate\" themselves in order to survive these chaotic eras that can sometimes last hundreds or thousands of years, IIRC. The game and the scientists who keep committing suicide are somehow related, and without giving too much away...aliens. That's just the first book, after that it gets crazy and really epic both in terms of scale and time. And like I said there are lots of sci-fi concepts that really make you go \"hmm\" when you view them through the lens of UFOs."

If I look a mile across the lake near where I live and see what looks like a car driving along the road around the lake, I don't know how fast it is going, but I do know if it looks like a speed a car can go. If it was going much faster than I think cars can go, I would then have to assume something else is going on. If you want a more mathematical look, I did some math here. Even if the balloon was not moving at all, it could look like it moves a pretty far distance just because the drone filming the video is moving. My point with this is not to prove how far the object moved or how far away the object was from the camera, it's just to prove that is a balloon is one reasonable explanation, you can come up with reasonable distances that are within the realm of possibility, and the math works out just fine.

That was simply a descriptor attached to it. It is important to understand that so that we don't rush to conclusions. Clearly, me making that distinction is upsetting, but I don't mean for it to be a personal attack. But I do think it is incredibly important to be careful about our words, and how we talk about data.

Just cuz someone moves doesn't mean it's them reacting somthing in the sky. We humans don't look up often. You give them far too much credit. They aren't all knowing super beings, Human eyes and brains are easily fooled by the perspective we have. The thought that you want to see a ufo means your brain will show you just that. Mine is always trying to poke holes in everything so I see a stationary object the that the camera can't focus on because it's moving too fast. Parallax is easy to see on the ground but once you add multiple heights to the equation it becomes much harder to understand. I don't blame people for not noticing. Higher quality and showing something less interesting and easier for people to debunk. If it's easier to debunk it will make more people Into ufo skeptics."

That's the point. Balloons don't move in perfectly straight lines, with perfectly constant velocity. Which seems to be the case here. To know, one would have to examine the video algorithmically and incorporate position data etc. from the drone. Same goes for shape. Again, perfectly spherical ones are highly unusual. They do exist, possibly, but would have to be custom-made. To find them in such an environment is more unusual still."
