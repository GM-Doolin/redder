In that vein, some things to consider: 1. Knowing that the story is that this debris is NOT what was recovered in the wreckage (and that it was intentionally replaced for this photo op), why would he be *holding a letter with this kind of sensitive info* in the photo? \"It was an oversight!\" Certainly possible... but that sort of mistake would certainly lower my confidence in an organization's ability to effectively cover something up. 2. Letters are written by authors who have agendas, bias, etc. They're certainly *good* evidence for a thing, but in the immediate wake of something like this it's good to keep in mind how information tends to flow. It is hectic, often unreliable, often prone to mistakes in interpretation made by observers, etc. I think it is *likely* that people coming across the wreckage would be trying to interpret it with the information and experiences that they currently had. Presuming it wasn't alien in origin, I think it would still be likely that people who saw the wreckage might genuinely think it was anyway. 3. Honestly, I highly doubt the method used here. I don't think the image snippets look like they match what is typed at all. Mod context indicates this isn't AI driven, which means it's just some person - who is predisposed to believing all of this - saying \"this looks like it says this!\""

This was a great distraction from any actual scrutiny at Groom Lake and similar sites where testing was done. You have to stretch super hard to find any accounts of aliens before this incident, why? Because it's propaganda, not the first encounter. Look at real evidence like the unedited NASA videos from space, it's an ocean out there and there's stuff living in it, but this event was just a good opportunity to blame any incursion into government sites as lunatics searching for little green men. This became increasingly useful as we entered the cold war. Actual alien life is weirder and more privative from what we've seen out there putting modern equipment into orbit. Space jellyfish, glowing objects moving at high speed. I'm not excluding more advanced versions, but they definitely aren't not flying car men that fascinated people in the 1950s."

They didn't have access to the same wormholes and dimensions to fly through as they do now, which increased the travel time in their Derium 506-p2 Flying Disc. By the time they got to earth, the 3 Aliens (ZeepBop - pilot, Hurglepod - pilot, and Yanfu - Navigator) were all getting shitty with each other from being cooped up in the tiny cockpit. It didn't help that ZeepBop was dating Yanfu's ex-wife and made it a point to remind Yanfu of that while going into details of their sex life. While ZeepBop and Hurglepod were trying to fly their Derium in Earths atmosphere, Yanfu decided that he had enough and shot ZeepBop with his deathray. ZeepBop died instantly. And Hurglepod freaked out, and the flying saucer crashed. How did I come across this information? It's classified. But I can assure you I don't have the luxury of guessing that happened. I know, man."

They came out with something where you could have a phone on a table recording audio and if someone was hitting keys on a keyboard, they could detect what keys were likely pressed. Possibly noisy, but enough to get real and actionable data. There's the \"Get Your Hands Off My Laptop\" attack where someone can literally like touch a laptop's chassis with a pen or something, and record voltage fluctuations (I think?). Using that, you can determine what operations the CPU is doing, and knowing those while something is decrypting can tell you what the key for decryption was. Someone did similar with an accurate microphone recording the humming of the CPU from many feet away. You can determine CPU instructions running, literally what code is getting processed. I have no doubt that whether this is real or not, someone with only slightly visible data like this could determine likely combinations of words and letters, and knowing the context and flow of English and military notes, might determine exactly what was written. People are fucking crazy good at shit like this sometimes, having just a tiny tiny avenue for getting the slightest bit of data, and being able to infer so much from it."

If there was a wreck with victims, I have no doubt Ramey would be receiving many letters a day regarding it. There are several reasons I think it\u2019s legitimate and a slip up on Ramey\u2019s part. 1) The original letter was never publicly released; even though it\u2018s official correspondence. 2) It\u2019s their office; it must have been buzzing with activity given the timeline. A brief press shoot would have deterred said activity. 3) In 1947 people didn\u2019t have paranoia around being photographed like we do today. 4) Ramey is pretty far from the camera for it to be intentional."

If you have a camera but don't have a microphone, you're recording only video and no audio. But an American university published an experiment where they showed an algorithm that can extract audio from that soundless video. The better the video, better the outcome will be. They film an empty living room with basic furniture, with classical music playing. When the algorithm is used, you can listen faintly the music that was playing. If it's a simple camera phone the sounds will be fainter because they can't analyze the vibrations as well as with a pro movie camera. But it works. You can extract audio from simple vibrations in a video. I can provide YouTube link for this experiment if anyone is curious"

And if the confidence of the ML system is high enough for a specific character, then you can go from there and form the strings of characters to form a word. Then, again, is confidence is high, you can determine what the word likely is. Then you put it through likely used phrases and etc. It's really not all thatagical, people just don't understand.
