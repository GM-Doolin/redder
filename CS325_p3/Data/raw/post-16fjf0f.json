This is similar to how, if we were to communicate with a 2D world, we would have challenges, but we would have to make ourselves known to them in a way by which they can perceive meaning from what we are trying to demonstrate. Does that make sense? All these basic geometric shapes; prisms, cuboids, spheres with cubes in them, all of these things are basic 3D geometric shapes with a lack of complexity I think Crop circles are the same sort of thing too, attempts to communicate with us in a 2D landscape using basic geometrics"

But at the least the free energy aspect should be released to the public.

As if the disparaging critics here are more thorough, more analytical, and have more resources available to them than the CURRENT Inspector General of the Intelligence Community and the folk that work underneath him. The very same active IGIC who is conducting an investigation on David Grusch's behalf regarding foul play and reprisal from superiors, the same IGIC who has been holding classified hearings on the UAP matter for at least 2 years now, and has personally deemed, with the authority of his office, Grusch's claims as credible and urgent. Not to mention the NDAA was written with the help of the White House and has been breezing through Senate just about unanimously. Also the fact we even have an AARO office (and all of its preceding legacy programs) in the first place. You guys are really speaking against so many degrees and accounts of credibility, and for what? Worst case scenario? Aliens were a red herring in order to safely embezzle funds to other legitimate secret programs ILLEGALLY and without oversight, and we were lied to for that very purpose for decades. And really I'm happy with that too, because at least it would actually be investigated.

I think this guy is a real believer but it's being used as a patsy of sorts in some kind of interagency/defense contractor internal struggle..."

Even Bob lazar chooses to believe the alien shit he saw was probably fake to test him if he would say shit or to be able to flag experiences to specific researchers, incase a whistleblower blows. IE every scientist working on the propulsion device is \"accidentally\" briefly exposed to a different color fake alien in passing when working on unbelievable technology, so if someone blows they can associate a scientist to a specific piece of specific fake information and identify the blowee. A red herring per sey. So if someone blows and distorts his voice and face and says he saw a blue alien at the facility working on xyz, they know only Bob was exposed to the fake blue alien when other people got setup to accidentally view other colors. I strongly believe that biologics are just a popular technique to identify whistleblowers and as a result the whistleblower community has whistleblowers who believe there's aliens because multiple people share similar experiences seeing things they weren't supposed to that was faked for intelligence, reinforcing their belief while also seeding a lie to protect the truth."

He has the propensity to lead the question and interrupts mid-sentence *all the time* (usually to name drop some scientist/theory that he knows). This in turn leads to Grusch speculating on things he has already previously said he can't discuss in public so he's essentially telling us nothing new, this whole thing is a 2 hours of speculation on the interviewer's part and just chit-chatting and not necessarily what Grusch knows about the phenomenon as fact but rather his opinions on what it could be for the most part. He agrees with pretty much everything the interviewer proposes as a possible theory. Even the thing about the NHI taking a different technological path is just Grusch personally speculating on what he thinks (he prefaces this by saying \"if I was a betting man\"). But for anyone interested in this part of the interview, this is the plot of Harry Turtledove's 1985 story *The Road not Taken*. The only new thing to come out (at least new to me) is the tie in between UFOs, the Manhattan Project, Atomic Energy Act, and the Department of Energy (kudos to the redditor who wrote a bunch of posts on this connection already). Feel like the actual time Grusch spoke was probably 20 minutes, if not less, and these youtubers, while knowledgeable on the topic surely, seemed really amateurish from a journalistic pov."

Something completely unfathomable to us because we have been focusing most of our science on streamlining reaction systems to be better and better instead of looking into other methods that we deem \"impossible\". Maybe the aliens are relatively the same age as us, just their path in tech focused more on gravity systems, telepathy, etc. Maybe they don't even use computers or AI like we have become advanced on, but they can travel vast distances/between dimensions.

I guess I don't believe it's actually Alcubierre's warp drive we're catching on radar, the physics relating to \"negative energy\" is off.Basically, the \"how it works\" is right, the \"how it's done\" is wrong. Truth is we're streamlining the mathematics with ai and supercomputers and recently lowered the energy requirement to warp spacetime from more mass than exists in the universe to the mass energy equivalent of a small star.. (Imagine what'll happen when a scientist that works in black budget programs \"discovers\" the proper mathematics to make warp drives work.)What they're missing with the alcubierre drive is a hack using superconductors, and high energy electromagnets, and what happens when you start rotating and pulsing them at high frequencies. This is obviously my biased speculation, but I have a decent accuracy rate with my predictions as confirmed by my partner and some friends over the years, but I acknowledge confirmation bias \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Honestly, I think the plan is to release this tech to humanity (partially because the world is ending) but it's gonna be a slow burn until the government-ai can automate every vehicle so no one drops dirty bombs from their Jetsons car. This will be a \"developing technology\" with notable moments in the next year or two, roughly 5-7 years from now, significant news coverage in 10, and working models in 15-20 being shilled as a newly developed technology. If all goes well I should be riding a spherical, ai powered, antigravitic taxi to work in the unflooded parts of the city in the final years before my retirement! Well..to touch again on the risk of this technology..from what I've learned these vehicles can't be weaponized in the traditional sense because you have a forcefield of high energy plasma between the craft and.. well..normal physics. Sure you might be able to shoot while you are still and just relying on mass negation, but you're a sitting duck. In \"motion\", bullets evaporate, rockets vaporize (possibly explosively), and don't even think about nukes.You need to utilize the same technology you're using to manipulate gravity.. So you focus your electromagnetic emmiters and generate plasmas that you can aim towards your target in real time. Evasive maneuvers? Who cares. Just flick the point where the 'beams meet' over there.Still, they (the ones keeping everything under wraps) need a way to ensure humanity won't blow themselves up with this tech. So.. Just wait until you have ai systems capable of running all your technology.They needed to wait until material science caught up of course, and I think we're getting there too. https://youtu.be/eS_rEzKdzBA?si=rnGkt9IFtqWb-39F https://youtu.be/8VWLjhJBCp0?si=axnntGwuw3aj68J1"

            "body": "You wanna hear some shit, let's talk Alfred North Whitehead, the man could math his ass off, and contributed significantly to the field of mathematics, so he's not some random dumb ass that was bad at other stuff so he moved onto philosophy. His story more so goes that, he got so good at math and science that he realized we're looking at everything from the wrong perspective, and our inability to consider things beyond ourselves as Alive and Reasoning. In fact he argues that Evolution although correct in some regards has reduced us to empty platitudes such as \"Survival of the Fittest\" despite everything which is alive being very unfit. As he puts it, \"The Art of Persistence is to be Dead.\" His point being that only Rocks and Stars and inert things have any level of success at survival for any extended period of time, and even then they too are subject to change. And so when we look at it from this perspective we can very much see how Science has fucked us in the long run by ignoring evidence to the contrary as outliers. Let us now discuss the Virus, as it exists in modernity it lies suspended in a state not unlike Schrodinger's infamous cat, neither alive, nor dead. Which is stupid, viruses are very much alive, however science says that because it cannot survive in our environment, and so it must not be like us on any level. Wrong and dumb they are the microbiologist, you wouldn't take a fish out of water and then go, \"This thing is not alive,\" why then would we examine a Viral Capsid outside of the human body and go, \"This thing is not alive.\" Surely if you take a man and drop him in the ocean with no equipment his fitness goes down immediately and eventually he dies, should we then suppose that humans aren't alive because they cannot survive in water for extended periods? Or is there a fundamental mistake in how we are measuring or considering the fitness of creatures? If we're being honest, what it means that Virsuses are alive would require us to redefine the fundamental aspects of what is required for life at the most basic level, RNA becomes much more significant in the grand scheme of things because viruses don't necessarily all have DNA, and so on and so forth. I'm not a microbiologist, but I know it would probably fuck some shit up a little bit. Anyway. Science cool, but its also willing to cut a lot of corners for simplicity sake"

If the public wants to know more, they need to know thst there is something imperative and grave about the response to documents that they haven't released for public consumption but Mr. Corbell is aware of them and has likely viewed them. And there are numerous reports about the things these guys want to say.... I would like to pause and ask if all of this is perfectly clear to viewers who may or may not be reading a comment, this comment now, that is probably one of the biggest comments about Knapp and Corbell, if not the biggest comment, and I've worked hard to bring this to light."

Since Djinni are said to have their own communities, they may have developed civilizations alongside, or independent of, humanity and/or climbed a separate, tech tree. Djinni have finite, albeit very long, lifespans of hundreds or even thousands of years, different tribes, factions, and even follow different religions. While coexisting, for better or worse or neutral, alongside us in this physical realm in a way we simply don\u2019t ordinarily perceive.

So there is a threshold that people are willing to breach the law and reveal things for the benefit of the American public and face the legal consequences. What does US troops killing civilians in Afghanistan and the (then) administration minimizing the active efforts Russia put in to sway the 2016 election, if those rise to the level of breaching the law to make public but a conspiracy to hide NHI's doesn't in 80 years, then it really seem credulous to think there is some meat behind that particular claim."

You can veteran this and that from the outside, but when you've been to theater you see some of these veterans be less than morally upstanding. I don't have to reveal more than that. I want you to consider that there are grifters out there, they are attracted to these exact situations... not being able to be proven wrong, and fanatic fans that don't question someone leasing their credentials to feed their desires. Psychologically blocking what I'm saying so you can keep imagining aliens saving us with high tech civilization any day now, or whatever, doesn't help people who end up wasting serious time and money on this. Hobby? sure. I've watched many hours of UFO disclosure, pyramids this and that. But allergic reactions to skepticism? seriously? I would love nothing more than for us to be part of a bigger universe populated by aliens that come here all the time. But if I don't say something here, I don't sit right with myself. So I've said my peace and yea, if I created some doubt, I've done what I feel is my duty in this situation. Communities with no doubt and don't question people who come with some authority are dangerous to themselves and others. Do you not doubt the official line? then you're in the same boat. Are you also \"hiding behind anonymity and a keyboard\" because you have an account here and don't want people harassing you for some opinion?

Also, the ICIG\u2019s investigation began back in 2021 so it should naturally be finished fairly soon. If the ICIG came out and said they found nothing, I would be very surprised, mainly because he\u2019s the only reason Grusch was able to speak to Congress in the first place. When a whistleblower files a complaint with the ICIG, they have to assess the credibility of the complaint based on the evidence provided. If it is deemed to be credible, then the whistleblower is forwarded on to Congress. So it would be pretty weird if the ICIG found Grusch\u2019s complaint credible at the time only to change his mind. We also shouldn\u2019t forget that Grusch testified he had the first hand witnesses provide a protected disclosure to the ICIG as well. Also note that the original ICIG is Grusch\u2019s personal lawyer, and his law firm normally only represents current government employees. So the fact that he\u2019s still choosing to represent Grusch, even though his firm finished Grusch\u2019s initial representation, suggests that the evidence Grusch and others possess must be pretty convincing. Regardless, if the ICIG says they found nothing to support Grusch\u2019s allegations then all I\u2019d do is wait until the disclosure bill is passed and the records are declassified. If nothing comes out, then I\u2019d happily admit that I was wrong."

Page 5: > CONTROLLING AUTHORITY.\u2014The term \u2018\u2018controlling authority\u2019\u2019 means any Federal, State, or local government department, office, agency, committee, commission, commercial company, academic institution, or private sector entity in physical possession of technologies of unknown origin or biological evidence of non-human intelligence. Page 6: > LEGACY PROGRAM.\u2014The term \u2018\u2018legacy program\u2019\u2019 means all Federal, State, and local government, commercial industry, academic, and private sector endeavors to collect, exploit, or reverse engineer technologies of unknown origin or examine biological evidence of living or deceased non-human intelligence that pre-dates the date of the enactment of this Act. > NON-HUMAN INTELLIGENCE.\u2014The term \u2018\u2018non-human intelligence\u2019\u2019 means any sentient intelligent non-human lifeform regardless of nature or ultimate origin that may be presumed responsible for unidentified anomalous phenomena or of which the Federal Government has become aware. Page 8: > TECHNOLOGIES OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN.\u2014The term \u2018\u2018technologies of unknown origin\u2019\u2019 means any materials or meta-materials, ejecta, crash debris, mechanisms, machinery, equipment, assemblies or sub-assemblies, engineering models or processes, damaged or intact aerospace vehicles, and damaged or intact ocean-surface and undersea craft associated with unidentified anomalous phenomena or incorporating science and technology that lacks prosaic attribution or known means of human manufacture. Page 18: > No unidentified anomalous phenomena record made available or disclosed to the public prior to the date of the enactment of this Act may be 12 withheld, redacted, postponed for public disclosure, or reclassified. > No unidentified anomalous phenomena record created by a person or entity outside the Federal Government (excluding names or identities consistent with the requirements of section ll06) shall be withheld, redacted, postponed for public disclosure, or reclassified. Page 30: > The President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint, without regard to political affiliation, 9 citizens of the United States to serve as members of the Review Board to ensure and facilitate the review, transmission to the Archivist, and public disclosure of government records relating to unidentified anomalous phenomena. > > The President shall make nominations to the Review Board not later than 90 calendar days after the date of the enactment of this Act. > > If the Senate votes not to confirm a nomination to the Review Board, the President shall make an additional nomination not later than 30 24 days thereafter. ^ this is bonkers. Page 30, here, this cited section, to me is batshit insane because it precludes the use of the Filibuster and *commands* both the President and Senate to keep nominating and voting *quickly* whenever all positions are not filled. The Senate and the President -- remember, the National Security Council both support the UAPDA -- are handcuffing themselves. This is not \"may\" language. It's compelled action. That does not happen. Pages 32-33: > QUALIFICATIONS.\u2014Persons nominated to the Review Board\u2014> > (A) shall be impartial citizens, none of whom shall have had any previous or current involvement with any legacy program or controlling authority relating to the collection, exploitation, or reverse engineering of technologies of unknown origin or the examination of biological evidence of living or deceased non-human intelligence; > > (B) shall be distinguished persons of high national professional reputation in their respective fields who are capable of exercising the independent and objective judgment necessary to the fulfillment of their role in ensuring and facilitating the review, transmission to the public, and public disclosure of records related to the government\u2019s understanding of, and activities associated with unidentified anomalous phenomena, technologies of unknown origin, and non-human intelligence and who possess an appreciation of the value of such material to the public, scholars, and government; and > > (C) shall include at least\u2014 > > * (i) 1 current or former national security official;> * (ii) 1 current or former foreign service official;> * (iii) 1 scientist or engineer;> * (iv) 1 economist;> * (v) 1 professional historian; and > * vi) 1 sociologist. This compels the President to nominate people with exceptionally narrow widespread recognized expertise in those explicit fields. Why an economist, historian and sociologist if it's all bullshit? Further of the Senate binding itself on Page 34: > HOLDING HEARINGS.\u2014Unless the Senate designates a different committee of jurisdiction, the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate shall hold confirmation hearings, and do so within 30 days after the first date in which the Senate is in session after the nomination of a minimum of 3 individuals for appointment to the Review Board, including the Executive Director established under section ll08(a). > > COMMITTEE VOTING.\u2014Unless the Senate designates a different committee of jurisdiction, the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate shall vote on the nominations, and do so within 14 days after the first date on which the Senate is in session after the confirmation hearings, and shall report its results to the full Senate immediately. > > SENATE VOTING.\u2014The Senate shall vote on each nominee to confirm or reject within 14 days after the first date on which the Senate is in session after reported by the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs or by a different committee as determined by the Senate.> > VACANCY.\u2014A vacancy on the Review Board shall be filled in the same manner as specified for original appointment within 30 days of the occurrence of the vacancy.> The Senate is binding itself to an *absolute* timeline here. It even makes it damned impossible to leave the Review Board understaffed. The US Senate by law has effectively removed all politics from the process outside of straight voting in the Committee and general body. Pages 49-50: > CONTROLLED DISCLOSURE CAMPAIGN PLAN.\u2014With respect to unidentified anomalous phenomena records, particular information in unidentified anomalous phenomena records, recovered technologies of unknown origin, and biological evidence for non-human intelligence the public disclosure of which is postponed pursuant to section ll06, or for which only substitutions or summaries have been 4 disclosed to the public, the Review Board shall create and transmit to the President and to the Archivist a Controlled Disclosure Campaign Plan, with classified appendix, containing\u2014 Then it goes on to spell out how the \"controlled disclosure plan,\" which is MANDATORY under law, will be transmitted and executed. What are we disclosing if it's not real? And here's the especially crazy part... the largest expansion of Eminent Domain in the history of the United States of America. Pages 57-58: > EXERCISE OF EMINENT DOMAIN.\u2014The Federal Government shall exercise eminent domain over any and all recovered technologies of unknown origin and biological evidence of non-human intelligence that may be controlled by private persons or entities in the interests of the public good. It even goes on to spell out how the Review Board can overpower even *Grand Jury* and similar ultra high-level legal lock outs to get at the data they want to get at. This is literally given the Executive Branch via Congress a degree of supremacy over the Judicial in this extremely narrow lane. Page 61 has my favorite \"curious\" bit, where it flat out says the UAPDA has precedence over literally any other law, full stop, the end. Why would all this be here, if it wasn't true, and why would the Senate declare, full stop, page 2, that this is happening if it is not?"

For instance, chimpanzees, observed by the likes of Dr. Jane Goodall, can be territorial and possessive over resources. This behavior, from an evolutionary lens, makes sense: hoarding can be a survival strategy. Furthermore, our brain's reward centers are tantalized by material acquisition, highlighting a neurological underpinning to greed. Yet, if we imagine extraterrestrial societies, two paths emerge: 1. Perhaps they evolved in environments where cooperation trumped competition. Just as Earth's ants and bees exemplify collective harmony, aliens might naturally prioritize the group over the individual. 2. Strong societal values emphasizing collective welfare could diminish greed. Earthly examples include the Aka hunters of Central Africa, who venerate sharing. Similarly, many human religions and philosophies, from Christianity to Buddhism, champion contentment and community. It's conceivable that alien belief systems would similarly temper materialistic urges."

There were at least three governments involved with this discovery in the 1930/1940, one of which was overthrown. Simply not possible. More recent evidence? Perhaps, but I still go back to the hearsay comment. If grusch had first hand accounts vs hearsay he would be much more believable."

My hope is that the ICIG report comes out with actual findings, while at the same time some of the dozens of whistleblowers who supposedly corroborated Grusch come out simultaneously to back it up. Do you know if any of the actual names of the private companies, military and research facilities being alluded to hold this material can be named in the ICIG's report?

Easy to say but Snowden did so just because people are being wiretapped. Grusch has f-ing NHI. Once he dropped the bombshell, it wouldn't take long for people to demand he get special treatment. I mean, if he can back up everything he's said, the US government has much bigger problems than making an example of Grusch. In fact, unlike Snowden, people would definitely be tuned in and asking why the guy that freed Americans from decades of lies was being charged with anything. Point is, its not cut and dry with either argument. If nothing else, Snowden proved that jail isn't the absolute outcome. People forget that Snowden also sees himself as a patriot. It really depends what exactly each is patriotic about."

There is no difference between a $1 bill and a $100 bill, they are both pieces of paper from a printer. When that paper loses value, wars and empires must be established and maintained. This is the case in every horrible thing throughout history. Fiat currency, Modern banking is the consequence of every conflict and misery on earth.

The problem with nuclear plants and the reason they aren\u2019t being built is they are very expensive to initially build and they take a long time to build. I still think it would be worth it to begin the switch completely. Even if we had a few meltdowns it would still be minor in the grand scheme of things. Also there is the oil companies which will do everything they can to stop this. They just want to make their money and don\u2019t care about the future or our health. They care about keeping their executives able to afford private jets. Sadly it will be very hard to defeat these companies because guess who they happen to fund? More then just our government. Any decision maker with power. I can only hope the rest of the average population can come to this realization and find that we have more power then we realize if we use it right.

The majority of the so-called \"green energy\" solutions are nowhere near as clean as people think. The materials required for solar panels and the batteries to store that energy have an alarming tendency to be mined by children in horrible conditions. The panels themselves only last a certain amount of time and then they aren't the kind of the thing you want littering landfills. China produces the majority of panels people are now buying (the few that can afford them that is) and we all know just how Green China isn't At the moment they are building new coal plants at a pace of one every other week. Unless we greatly expand nuclear energy then essentially nothing will change there simply isn't a reliable cheap substitute for fossil fuels. If we tried to stop all fossil fuels tomorrow society would fall apart and millions would be dead in a week. Way too many people have an unrealistic almost fanatical desire to switch from fossil fuels immediately and that's a pipedream. Even if we somehow just decided to stop using fossil fuels tomorrow and everyone could somehow afford an electric car, where do you think the electricity to charge the cars comes from? Mostly Coal. It honestly wouldn't make a whole hell of a lot of difference on a global scale. Not when China and other nations have no interest or capability to change their ways. People need to stop turning the climate into a religion where there can be no conversation without flying into a rage. We need to have calm reasoned and realistic discussion. Regardless humans will continue to do what we have always done, adapt and survive. Sitting in the middle of the highway with signs or glueing yourself to the wall beside some masterpiece isn't changing anyone's mind or making any positive difference. All that does is piss people off. Human innovation will continue and hopefully we can stumble on some new breakthrough or just maybe disclosure can help out. Maybe there is some brilliant alien zero point energy device locked away in a corporate hangar somewhere just waiting for us to make use of it. That's assuming of course that we can grasp how it works and replicate the materials necessary to build more. I have faith that something will change"

I understand why people might think this, it just often plays out the exact opposite in reality. That's the challenge of this topic, and the bridge that needs gapped. Religions have been proselytizing stories of non-human, transcendental encounters for centuries, while more global, science-driven, secular society is a much more recent phenomena. Now we're better able to collect quantitative data about things that once seemed esoteric and unreachable, and it's possible that we'll come to a point (or are already at a point) where we have to square up some things between the two to make sense of it, even if it's just a semantic change. It's telling that one of the biggest opponents (or at least bitter, argumentative skeptic) of a visitation hypothesis these days is Neil deGrasse Tyson."

Those of us with the resources (made possible due to the initial energy density and economics of fossil fuels) need to reach the next step of the ladder.

Yet, it's undeniable that certain systems, particularly capitalism, have surpassed others in their ability to rapidly distribute wealth, alleviate poverty, and fuel innovation. This very prowess led it to supersede feudalism, which in turn had replaced the hunter-gatherer systems. However, this evolution has brought significant environmental repercussions and other unforeseen consequences.

It seems very anti-science to simply say \u2018he is wrong and crazy\u2019. He might be, but let\u2019s check his work first to find out. Let us investigate to find out if there is proof, before we dismiss everything. In my opinion anyway!"

You don't have any proof so you can just move on. It's fine if you're saying he 'going to' do that. That's fair but don't make up a bunch of incredulous bullshit and act like it's a fact."
