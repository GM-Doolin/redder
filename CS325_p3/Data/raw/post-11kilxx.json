There\u2019s less compression artifacts and this copy isn\u2019t as cropped in so and you can see the foreground better. This gives it a better look in my opinion. Note how the foreground bounces around more from the car yet the cloud line does not as much do to distance parallax. This object stays relative to the clouds. I think it is definitely a video worth a closer look and not something we should let our bias quickly dismiss off hand."

Could it be that, that tech is now replicatable and what people see is confounded by this idea that somehow certain beings in the USA have figured out the tech and have something to do with the increase in sightings? As far as I see it, if it is a system of complicated and drawn out manipulation then people are believing what they're expected to believe. Looking back in time, It seems that it's only those people who tend to think outside the box and ask more questions than they try to answer and have no vested interest in a specific outcome, who tend to be closer to the answers. It's an almost perfect puzzle/riddle that I think is just about to be answered but we'll see I suppose. Just saying."

I didn't understand why, so I always thought it moved so fast that it caused that effect. I seen it in the 90s . I told my brother \"hey remember that one time...\" maybe a year or so ago and went over how we had seen it together...and all the hairs on his arm stood up. He said \" nah bro...that was a dream \" and I was like wth are you talking about? We've never had no shared dream. He brushed it off and said it was probably an experimental aircraft back then. He's really religious, and he doesn't like to entertain conversations that have anything to do with such topics. He wasn't always that way though. To me this little clip looks fake as hell. My little story probably sounds unbelievable as well though.

It would be a lot more palatable to accept that this is fake if I didn't have to wade through the usual sarcastic muck that this sub has become. I don't even follow this sub for interesting discourse around the phenomenon anymore. I see a clip then go straight to the comments to read the opinions of all the \u201cprofessionals\u201d that take time out of their obviously busy day to offer a well thought out quip, oh the effort that must go into such thoughtfulness. Is there fake stuff here? Probably, definitely. Is there real stuff here? Probabl, definitely. Either way we wouldn't know because any actual discussion is cut off right from the first moment. I don\u2019t understand if this is because of an organic movement in this sub ( in which case I apologize as I would then be the outlier) or there is some sort of misinformation thing going on here. Everybody likes to shit on Tom Delonge, even I admit he is over the top sometimes. But the truth is TD has a lot to loose by looking silly, more so then most. But you know what TD has that the rest of us don't. He has undeniably sat in a room with the likes of Chris Melon, Luis Elizondo, Harold Puthoff and Jim Semivan. He has undeniably met with and discussed the phenomenon with people in the military government, intelligence and science. So when Tom posts something, I\u2019m going to give it a good look and at least give it the benefit of a doubt. What I\u2019m not going to do with this sub anymore is listen to people who have zero expertise zero experience and zero credibility, and don\u2019t even take the time to have a civil discussion without sarcasm. I have spent my entire life being the butt end of jokes because I refuse to believe that out of the 80 000 000 000 planets in the Milky Way Galaxy, earth is the only one with life. Edit 1"

Something very similar to what's in this video started covering the whole sky going awfully slow, and seemed like it was pretty low. The shape was similar to the one in this video, but more of an obtuse triangle. We couldn't tell what the color was cause it was dark out, but it looked like it was black. No flashing lights or anything like a normal plane would have. Just pure darkness in the shape of a triangle. I was the first one to see it, pointed it out and everyone just had a quiet \"what the fuck?\" And we all went silent just watching it. All 6 of us saw it, so I know I wasn't going crazy. Eventually, it went out of our sight because of a big ass tree, but to this day, I randomly think about that thing. If I had to say how big it was, it was at least 3 football fields put together side by side. It was fucking HUGE. Sometimes I stare into the sky, hoping to see it again. But it's been over 7 years."

When we ran to a different vantage point to continue watching the craft, it was completely and instantly gone and nowhere to be found at all.

Or could it be some normal result of whatever this camera was moving fast? It's not just the \"object\" that's visible through the poles, so does that mean the poles are also imposed on the image or what?"

And when the streak of light occurs the framerate has suddenly improved to 5-6 frames per second, just good enough to make out that it's going warp speed. Kind of convenient right.... well that's the problem. Whoever made the video fucked up because in that discrepancy they didn't hide their tracks very well, or they just assumed nobody was going to analyze this video to tell they inserted extra frames to generate that smooth light beam in Adobe After Effects. If this were real and it was an object suddenly warping out of existance the light would be extremely blurry and we'd be lucky to see1 frame at the most, let along 5-6. Because at that speed it's nearly impossible to get such a quality image from it. Any video editor will confirm this."

Edison destroyed Tesla's credibility by first making his DC current seem dangerous when in fact it's Edison's that pisses a risk; and then encouraging a wild goose chase, which ultimately described anything with Tesla's name on it before 1850. Nikola Tesla was not wrong about a great many things. But he didn't have Edison's eloquence. It's really that simple. DeLonge isn't credible. That doesn't make him wrong. It just means he comes off as a crackpot who's into this for the money. Nobody takes him seriously, because he's too invested in the idea of investment itself. That's why they moved away from him. Credibility. Not fact, not likeability, and certainly not because Tom is fake. It's because Tom is just \"off\" enough that he doesn't seem to know what he's doing. Tom's credibility in the music industry simply doesn't translate to credibility in this topic. Everyone hoped for a couple years. But it became clear that he simply can't command enough respect to make TtSA work. Not even in the community where it seems logical that he might be able to bring people together. They left him behind for that one reason alone. Credibility counts. Tom did that to himself. Nobody else did that to him. Unlike Tesla."

The exhaust from the engine looks equally as big as the craft leaves the frame. Nothing else in the scene is lit by the engine exhaust. The video creator brightened the clouds uniformly, but otherwise nothing else changes. A flash of light this size (like a massive lighting strike) would illuminate the area around it, unevenly - we see nothing lit on the ground, we see no concentration of light in the clouds around the light source, no changes to the camera lens etc. There's probably more clues. The tracking ain't great, it seems to match the camera's frame. It's not really hovering still, it bounces up and down with the camera shake. It's focus never really changes. Someone saw the Chinese city in the sky debunked video from Captain Disillusion, and made their own. If it were real, we need to think that this one person in a car was the only one to see it? Something this huge? With this amount of light? Where is the sound? This moved pretty quick, and it's in atmosphere. It will have to do something right? It'll displace air regardless of how advanced it is, and that will create some sort of sound. \"How are we meant to know what advanced technology looks like?\" We won't, it's true. But we sure as hell know what a physical object looks like in real life, and we sure as hell know how to spot computer-generated art - we are fairly good at those things."

A thin object that sweeps over the sensor with constant velocity during the time the aperture is open will in fact create a sharp sweep like that. Imagine the photo is taken during one second. Divide the second into e.g. ten parts.Divide the area swept over by the pole into ten parts similarly. Over the total time, the pole will spend 1/10 s in each of the \"tenths\". But 9/10 of the total time, light will pass through from behind. (In reality it's continuous, not divided into discrete parts, but it's easy to understand.) The sharp edge comes from that the pole is fairly thin, so that it darkens every part of the sweep almost equally. A *wide* object would give you a darker (and less transparent) area in the middle, because it spends more time blocking the light in the middle than it does near the edges.

That's not to say that this isn't fake, more that modern smartphone camera tech can make it really hard to tell.

A crude example would be a bottle of water and you fill the bottle with enough air to replace the water. The atmosphere is the bottle the ship is the water and its propulsion system shoots the ship out of our atmosphere just as the water would shoot out of the bottle if you filled it with air. With this theory you would be able to avoid the air collapsing as the mass would not change it would just be replaced. Just food for thought."
