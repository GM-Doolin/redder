What we really want is to train models to perform particular tasks better than we can. We most definitely don't want them to have emotions\n\nEven for conversations-optimised AIs to serve as tutors, assistants and stuff like that, there will be no need to go as far as to make them equivalent to humans.\n\nI think ChatGPT serves as a pretty good example of the incentive structures at play here. It is more or less able to hold a \"proper conversation,\" but it's very dull and robotic. One might be tempted to assume that this simply means that the AI isn't sufficiently advanced yet, but the reality is that it is very much by design. Companies have a strong incentive to make their AIs as \"safe\" and \"harmless\" as possible. ChatGPT can talk, but it doesn't talk like a person, it talks like a tool that can talk. GPT-3, without the conversational optimisation, is far less dull by comparison, so I believe this show the direction we are going in. \n\nhttps://open.substack.com/pub/erikhoel/p/the-banality-of-chatgpt?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android\n\nI think this articles takes a very good at it. Here is a passage that I particularly like:\n> Interacting with the early GPT-3 model was like talking to a schizophrenic mad god. Interacting with ChatGPT is like talking to a celestial bureaucrat.\n> Of course, there's plenty of fun stuff you can do with a celestial bureaucrat at your side. Like asking it for recipes, most of which seem pretty good (stay tuned for an upcoming \u201cCooking with ChatGPT\u201d post). There\u2019s also the potential for AI tutoring of children\u2014although at its current level, it often gets a lot wrong on more technical subjects, and can be lead too easily down the garden path of nonsense. I don\u2019t expect this to be conquered anytime soon for advanced subjects, but possibly for early education, which can be more easily fine-tuned in its answers, it could work. So maybe some future celestial bureaucrat can teach children subjects one-on-one, acting like the aristocratic tutors of old. But even so, to give more correct answers, to give replies that are academically standardized and checkable, it must necessarily become even more constrained and typified. Already OpenAI has released statistical ways to tell if prose comes from ChatGPT. \n> Therefore, I think the banal nature of these AIs may be unavoidable, and their love of cliches and semantic vacuities"

That we do not know more does not justify introducing mysticism or caveats. When we do not have further information, the accepted model is the simplest explanation. Which would be that consciousness just arises from the arrangement of matter.\n\nSo you probably agree on that but I just want to clarify that not knowing does not imply that one should prove all alternatives impossible.\n\nI think there are three primary other ways to argue that it should in principle be possible for robots to also be sentient without biological material. I am arguing these on the level of in principle possible though, rather than being realistic. We do not know how likely it is that the universe will develop in various ways. So instead what I am arguing is that with known physical laws, we could imagine an arrangement of matter such that consciousness arises - even if we may not be able to perform that arrangement.\n\nThe first method is through simulation. The second method is through transforming biological matter into equivalent synthetic. The third method is try to argue that it must be a property of function invariant substrate.\n\nI think the first method is simplest.\n\nDo you grant the following?\n\n* Supposing that we could arrange matter however we liked in the universe, it should be possible to also create a gigantic computer that can accurately simulate physical laws of a contained area for at least a couple of simulated-world seconds (the simulation does not have to be 1:1).\n* This simulation could simulate the biological matter of a human.\n* If consciousness is just a property of the arrangement of matter, the human in the simulation is consciouss iff the human outside is.\n* Hence robots can have consciousness."

It's not about complexity, it's about architecture.  If you run it with empty input, it won't get bored and request a human to help (or make any other moves to fulfill a desire), it will just spit out \"answers\" that are either repetitive or increasingly nonsensical.  It can get more accurate, but it can't grow to think.\n\n\nAs living things we have an architecture based on self-perpetuation, and we are ***electrochemical***, not electrical.  Each individual cell in our body has memory and has some capacity for adaptation that can be argued to be learning.\n\nNeutral networks do not function like neurons, they are inspired by our understanding of the brain, they do not model it.  Our brains are not made by simple weights and biases, they are cells - every single cell has a reaction to hunger, stress response, activity periods, and individual adaptation.  Plus, malfunctions based on not enough of necessary chemical precursors or alternate behaviors based on the presence of molecules that alter or inhibit chemical pathways.\n\n\nAgain, I'm not saying math problems can't think - I absolutely believe they can.  But it's not a matter of complexity, they require an architecture that allows them to do.  Life has this intrinsically, because living things become dead if they lack the internal drive to keep their body in homeostasis.  It must want and need.  It must predict the behavior of the world, and react to maintain homeostasis before it's chemical balance becomes shaky\n\nAn AI needs to be built to have the architecture for thought.  It needs to want things, it needs to predict reality, and it needs to be able to change modes of operation depending on the wants and state of it's world.\n\nAnd that is why chatgpt and other contemporary NN don't want anything, and can't want things - they're just math problems.  They're not more than that, and no matter how good they get at prediction and even creation, they won't \"wake up\" one day.\n\nIf you want to create AGI, don't try to build a super-intelligence that can answer all our questions.  Try to build a pet rat\n\nIt's not a matter of complexity, it's a matter of architecture"
