            "body": "The \"manta balloon\" from Festo was a prototype about 15 years ago. Only one made, never hit the market, never sold. 15 years. Made to \"float\" indoors, that's why all the videos about it are made indoors. Incapable of reaching 20.000 feet. It can barely \"float\" indoor with the help of a little push because it doesn't have the necessary volume to contain more helium. Even less to reach 20.000 feet. The fact that this resembles the shape (and only the shape) of something made 15 years ago, doesn't mean is that."

What\u2019s interesting is that the UAP looks to be stationary as the pilot flies by. It\u2019s important to remember what Ryan Graves spoke about on the Joe Rogan podcast. These UAP would remain stationary for several hours, not changing their trajectory and essentially just hovering in one place. Ryan Graves and his team had the same interaction as this pilot had on almost a daily basis. We should consider this and not expect every UAP sighting to be of a moving object that is flying at insanely high speeds like the gimbal video. I hope someone can debunk this as it is very interesting footage and may be some of the highest quality material captured in recent years. Edit: Debunk as in prove it\u2019s something other than a balloon."

I bet it looks all wonky on the one side due to a lensing effect of this of what could be a gravitational field or high EMP field around the craft.

Secondly the intro and out roll of the footage. Where and why would someone be taking video particularly of a blank sky. Why would someone simply stop the recording without some attempt to follow the object. This usually results in camera shake and desperate moves to reacquire the object.

Maybe that\u2019s for sensors of some kind or airflow. Hard to tell but the top side looks like it\u2019s some type of black material similar looking to stealth material we\u2019ve seen.

The frames of 1:53-1:54 1st frame, there is no object 2nd the frame, distortion of the clouds happens, and the object appears/pops in (I do not think this is gravitational warping as you will see in a second) 3rd frame object is still there same clouds as 2nd frame but different than 1st now onto 1:54 1st frame, the object disappears, and clouds are distorted (like they have been brushed) 2nd frame, object is back, the clouds are slightly shifted to the left, as in the mask itself and the viewport are shifted slightly, you can see the edge as you go back and forth"

Its most likely just a balloon of unknown design or origins despite what we all want it to be.

Probably the size of a smart car at most and a couch cushion at the smaller end. * Parallax is really hard to explain to someone without them seeing it. * Balloons come in all shapes and sizes. * This is something I could probably replicate, and there are much better people out there at making shit than me which means the chances this is a science project or something not terribly unlikely. I'm not saying it's a balloon, but it seems like it's got a whole lot of balloonish qualities. If you fly by a bird in the air, it looks EXACTLY like this in terms of perspective and speed. I flew by a grocery bag once. That also looked like this. I don't see anything really weird about this other than the shape, and even that isn't THAT weird. I think the fact they seem to be looking for it or know it's coming means maybe they already saw it and circled back to get video."

And one video of one incident, clear or blurry does not meet the expected amount of evidence to satisfy the claim we are being visited by ETs. If as many of these videos people claim are real, were in fact real, then why has there never been any clear video from multiple angles from multiple independent people. Surely a ufo would have flown over a city by now, where dozens of people could record it at the same time. These things are in the sky, not hiding out in the woods like bigfoot. Also, why are these ufo videos often of pretty different vehicle designs. We have vehicles that fly in vacuums and/or atmosphere, and they look nothing like most of these videos. The same physics that dictates our designs would also apply to any other alien civilization. Also, why do many of these videos show objects flying in seemingly impossible ways. Doing maneuvers that imply tremendous performance, or have no visible means of propulsion. The answer is either we are wrong about some basic stuff, or the videos are fake/not fully understanding what is going on, e.g. forced perspective or other similar such optical effects/illusions. I'm leaning on fake/misunderstanding, myself, given that my first contention has not been satisfied. I think it would be great if UFOs were real, by just knowing such a thing exists and what it approximately looks like could greatly accelerate our technological advancement. Just knowing something is possible is often enough to get started working on it. We could ignore some fields and focus more on ones that could explain a hypothetical ufo encounter."

Do we ever consider that alien life might be closer to the size of insects on Earth? Can you imagine how many crafts could by flying around in our skies right now if the crafts themselves were the size of a fly? We know that brain size is not necessarily tied to intelligence by observing animals like corvids (we also know that something like a hive mind can create intelligence as a community rather than an individual). We also know that in the case of extreme global catastrophe, the most likely survivors would be something like tardigrades or small insects, which means they are the most likely to win the evolution race in the long, long run. Would be interesting if we found out that these \"small\" craft that appear to be around the size of a beach ball actually contain entire populations of teeny tiny beings. &#x200B; anyway.

If it weren\u2019t for sale, they wouldn\u2019t link you to the online store. You\u2019re so deadset on believing otherwise though so you\u2019re linking an old interview that says what you like.

I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not unusual or UAP related but it doesn\u2019t have any exotic flight characteristics or signatures of being UAP besides it\u2019s unusual shape and it\u2019s similarity to the gimbal video. If its most likely just a balloon of unknown design or origins despite what we all want it to be. However, If we knew the winds direction and speed and / or it\u2019s altitude we might be able to discern some more interesting characteristics about it but as it stands it\u2019s not to stand up as evidence that helps disclosure.

Our minds our tied to the physical world and it's limitations. There is only so much that can fit in one space. Whether the human brain has some or is even reaching some physical limit in intelligence is actually a debated topic. Hives/swarms having intelligence, as far as I know, isn't really used to describe the whole hive having independent intelligence. They basically have a hyper form of democracy in their collective actions. Depending on how intelligence is defined hives/swarms absolutely display signs of intelligence. However, that's very much in the same way a group or community of people would too. Touching back to the limits of human intelligence. One of the points sometimes discussed is that even if humans had a physical limit. It's much more questionable whether there's a limit to our collective intelligence. Now, on top of the potential physical limits of a small brain. There's also physical limits for technology when sizing down that small. Just looking at today, things are already hard to make things small. That isn't because no multi-billion dollar company isn't trying either. Making tech tiny is just more and more difficult the smaller you go with diminishing returns. There will absolutely be size limits with how small we can make tech that'll come to the point of constantly coming up with basically totally new technology and even new material. Not to say tiny little aliens are impossible. Just that they have an even greater hurdle than humanoid sized aliens."

Whatever we are seeing in this frame grab is technically not as \"clear\" as advertised. The original video is a more accurate representation. In the video, the object is very small in relation to the entire frame, so there is not much detail in the image. It seems more likely that the pilot captured a smaller object that was stationary rather than a larger object further away based upon the focal length of the lens and how slowly the camera panned as they passed the floating object. To me, a small silver balloon makes sense. They come in different shapes and sizes at most party supply stores."

Here\u2019s a quick summary of each regulation that applies to our flights: 1.Cell Phones are not permitted to track high-altitude weather balloons in flight.2.Payloads cannot exceed a package weight/size ratio of three ounces per square inch. *3.No payload package can exceed 6 lb in weight.4.Entire weight of all payloads cannot exceed 12 lb in total weight (Excludes weight of balloon).5.No rope or cable should be used which requires more than 50lb of force to separate payload packages from balloon.6.No one may launch a high-altitude weather balloon which creates a hazard to other people and property. (i.e. Incorrect parachute, faulty rigging, inappropriate launch location)7.No one may use a high-altitude weather balloon to drop objects (i.e. gliders and projectiles).\u201d Unmanned balloons have surprisingly few restrictions.

Because I think the former is much more likely than the latter, given the massive technological leaps the human race has made specifically in aerospace over the last 100 years. And then there's always the possibility that it's some kind of government psy-op or the Gimbal footage is a red herring for foreign governments, which given how our government has operated since Operation Paperclip, I'm not sure don't *also* pass Occam's Razor over aliens. Moreover, many of the historical phenomena you're describing could be attributed to anything from mass hysteria to hallucinations brought on by religious rites or mental illness. I think this is a must read for anyone who believes themselves to be seriously engaged in UFO speculation: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\_Demon-Haunted\\_World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Demon-Haunted_World) Sagan here gives us a pretty ironclad blueprint for thinking critically about the UFO and alien abduction phenomena.

It must either be partially inflated at the bottom, to allow expansion as the pressure from the atmosphere reduces. The volume of the balloon is key to its power, not the pressure of its content. A large balloon only half filled will lift less, at any altitude. There is no reason the balloon would be partially inflated at max altitude. There is a reason the balloon could be filled completely to atmospheric pressure on the ground. To increase its initial lifting capacity. It would require to release or compress helium ad it ascends to avoid increasing pressure at altitude. I could see this being a first option balloon on ascent because they tend to fly way higher than small aircraft."

The video shows a pilot maneuvering to line himself up to pass something in the sky, and as soon as he is lined up he passes it and gets a pretty clear shot. And of the man made objects we know of that can get to that altitude, even briefly, a mylar balloon either shaped, deformed by altitude, or both, easily fits the pretty clear video taken when it passes. Deductive reasoning suggests the event occurred as filmed, and it's a mylar balloon. This idea would be falsified by evidence showing CGI manipulation and I would happily retract my statements if a convincing argument were to come out.

It is positively buoyant when you let go, because the gas in the baloon weighs less than the equal volume of air, thereby it rises. The pressure on the gas inside decreases as the baloon rises, and it will either expand or have to be removed from the baloon. As it roses through the atmosphere, it will reach a point where the air is at such low pressure, and therefore lighter, that the helium can no longer lift the weight of the baloon itself. It will stop rising because the weight of the total baloon is equal exactly to the weight of an equal volume of air. It is neutrally buoyant. Scuba divers do the same thing by carrying lead weights and an adjustable air bladder. They add and release air as they change depth in order to perfectly balance the sinking effect of the weight so the don't rise or sink at all."

Distortion of the shape requires a number of assumptions to be made which can neither be validated or disproved. Examples may be the existence of an internal structure or atmospheric conditions. Thirdly there is no evidence that it is a balloon other than people saying I think it\u2019s a balloon. This is not sufficient reasoning to draw a conclusion.

See, I don't have any reason to add \"alien spaceship\" to the list of \"is this a balloon, CGI, or...?\" as there is nothing in the video that shows anything even remotely out of the ordinary. I wouldn't consider adding UFO any more than I'd consider adding an invisible robot sky falcon dropping metallic floating turds. The remaining question, is this a balloon or CGI, by appearances in this short but detailed video would be answered with, balloon. You can choose to overcomplicate things beyond that. I won't."
