He also wasn\u2019t actually a physicist at Los Alamos as he claimed (the phonebook commonly referenced actually shows he was a contractor performing work there on behalf of Kirk Meyer), and clearly exaggerates or outright makes things up to support his narrative, like in Jeremy\u2019s documentary when he insinuated that the FBI raid was for element 115 and that they specifically referenced a private convo with Jeremy during the raid. This was Michigan law enforcement conducting the search, you really think they have his phone tapped and have been hunting him down for the 115 he apparently stole almost 40 years ago? It\u2019s possible Bob had some inside knowledge of real things going on, but I just can\u2019t see a reality where this dude was given the most top secret clearance to reverse engineer alien spacecraft when his education and professional experience did not qualify him whatsoever."

My impression of him is that he's obviously been keenly interested in UFOs for a long time and read up on all the other reports, sightings and probably spoken rumors at UFO conventions. And he decided to pool all of that together to fabricate a big story with him as the main character. The whole thing served him well, allowing him to get books published and to get paid for speaking tours. And the \"best part\" from his POV is? He borrowed so much from other stories, he's got a good chance at least SOME of what he said will match up with future evidence. So it helps validate his tales."

Stratton and professor Max Millikan to discuss UAP sightings and a means of studying them through Project Lincoln. Lincoln was an already established air defense project at MIT for the USAF, specifically analyzing photographic reconnaissance and surveillance* *The December 1952 memo suggests Lincoln had an interest in flying saucer cases beginning in mid-1952, and CIA OSI sought \u201cfull backing\u201d of the DCI for MIT to formally study UAP. Unfortunately, no further Lincoln UAP documentation exists, and Lincoln summary reports do not mention UAP despite Stratton\u2019s interest. USAF Capt. Edward J. Ruppelt later writes that Project Lincoln\u2019s Beacon Hill Group recommended he set up \u201csound detection apparatus\u201d in areas of UAP activity, suggesting the MIT scientists were doing actual UAP work under contract* https://pdfhost.io/v/gR8lAdgVd_Uap_Timeline_Prepared_By_Another"

I was always on the fence about Lazar but when the discovery or creation of 115 was announced it made me lean more towards Lazar being legit. Another thing that made me think he was legit, and not many people know this, is he talked about this hand scanner that was used when entering the facility. It had the shape of a hand on it, you placed your hand on it and it measured the bone density of your hand. People laughed at that because at that time there supposedly was no security device like that. But guess what, years later Knapp actually found the device Lazar was talking about. Make of that what you will."

I\u2019ve since learned more, even some of the odd things, and I think I was right. He\u2019s a little sleazy, and may have embellished some things (hard not to when you love scifi, even if you are just filling in gaps of understanding) but the core of his story is true. It\u2019s going to be awesome if the whole story comes out. Side note: one of his interviews in the 80/90s he mentioned the management didn\u2019t care if it came out, it already had multiple times and is the easiest secret to keep. Lines up! Not sure about element 115, someone said the half life is like 2 seconds but he also said they had a stable form of it. This also lines up again with the 4chan leak (get in trouble if mentioned Lazar) and there was another post about 115 being the most precious part of downed craft, not sure where that post went."

I REALLY respect that he's still enduring, whether it's his own folly, or others that have discredited him. Even if he was just a janitor, who happened to see a thing, and then embellished his role upon it a bit...what he saw was probably true. I'm inclined to believe him more, though, these days. That even if he wasn't the most perfect person to hire--on the flipside, the gov knew that they could discredit him on a moment's notice. For that reason, it's sometimes safer to recruit people with shady pasts, because it's way easier to distance from them, if need be. If the program ever needs to \"burn\" someone, it's easier if that someone has some dirt on them that you can take advantage of. So, when I look at Lazar, I can imagine that the worst suspicions of his personal character might be true...and I don't even care about that, if he happened to be in the right spot at the right time, to witness some things. Some alien coverup shenanigans, by the U.S. government (and yes others, for similar reasons) And he was fuckin' RIGHT!! Gad DAMN, we're living in a crazy world, right now.

            "body": "*\"The Oppenheimer thing, and so I wasn\u2019t really involved in any of it. But I do remember that when I went first to Los Alamos and that would\u2019ve been in \u201943, and then after the war when I came back in \u201949, there was this big argument going on about whether we should work on the thermonuclear. And the opponents of working on it were very close to Oppy. John Manley. Oppy wasn\u2019t there anymore, but John Manley was and John Manley had been the secretary to the General Advisory Committee, and was very close to Oppy even before the project started. He was sort of Oppy\u2019s gofer on coordinating experiments throughout the country. John Manley did that. And I was just appalled that we wouldn\u2019t work on it. And of course the major influence on saying no was Oppy. So if you read the testimony, I think Teller got sort of a bum rap in that if you read the testimony he says all good things about how Oppy ran the project. He also says that if he were going to choose somebody to do it, he would still choose Oppy. But then he says, I really wouldn\u2019t like him to be in a position of setting policy, or whatever it is. And I think that was because of his opposition to the hydrogen bomb work, which if we hadn\u2019t proceeded, really would\u2019ve been a disaster politically. Between the Soviets, because of \\[Klaus\\] Fuchs, they knew what was going on and they actually, as I mentioned, had a deliverable thing before we did. So if we hadn\u2019t worked on it, you know as far as whatever the global politics are concerned, I think things could\u2019ve really been tilted the wrong way. So I think in that context, Teller was right. But immediately he became the b\u00e9te noir of the pro-Oppenheimer people. I know \\[Robert\\] Christy wouldn\u2019t even shake hands with him and Bradbury sort of had a ruling that he was not to visit Los Alamos. So from that time until I became director, Teller was never allowed to come to Los Alamos, which I thought was ridiculous. As soon as I became director, I invited him to spend the summer, which he jumped at and came. I did it for several reasons. Whether you get along with him or not, you can love him one day, you can hate him the next day because he\u2019s a very dynamic figure.* ***And I figured first, from an intellectual standpoint, he would be good for the lab. I thought as far as the troops there were concerned, the fact that he would wander around and talk to people, I thought, gee, you know, this is really good, because I could see the guys going home, telling their wives, you know, I spent a couple of hours with Edward Teller today, and this is just a good thing.*** *He was a very stimulating guy. But I did have a problem because I realized when I invited him that with Edward you \\[00:45:00\\] need a keeper. You need a keeper. And I wasn\u2019t sure what to do because you had to have a smart keeper, because you were trying to get a good impression as far as the lab was concerned as far as Edward was concerned because he was quite influential politically in those days. So I chose a guy, Jay \\[George A.\\] Keyworth, who had the intellect, the drive, and boy, they got along just great\".* Los Alamos National Laboratory Director Harold Agnew, 2005. Page 21. The guy that was on the B-29 and loaded the plutonium core into the Fat Man enroute to Nagasaki. https://special.library.unlv.edu/ark%3A/62930/d19k4649n Remember when Bob Lazar said he bumped into Edward Teller in the courtyard, reading the newspaper with his jet car story on the front page?

Whatever happened next, it happened because he got rear-ended by the government that should have protected him. He's vindicated. Without Lazar, who's to say that TTSA/Mellon/Elizondo/Stratton had been able to craft a plan so that a Grusch character could reign in this period of disclosure.

Then the truth comes out and all those little details that people thought they had were right, well, they WERE right, but the context wasn't. Or people broke the pieces down so much that they were looking for issues that weren't there. Or rules were applied that work in 2023 but not in 1988. Imagine that you find out someone else paid for Lazar to go to MIT and get fast-tracked for employment reasons. Then you find out Lazar didn't go through the same process nor have the same credentials as normal, but she was hired at Los Alamos because someone did see that car article and wanted someone ambitious and young and so they interviewed him. He wasn't hired directly for the UFO program but they liked him and moved him over.

Edit; also, Chris Mellon low key debunked Lazar on Rogan. Stated exactly what he did at Los Alamos which was definitely not researching UAP craft.

It does not take any great leap of intuition to guess that if flying saucers were going to be stored anywhere in the USA, the most likely place would be the Nevada Test range, where all the secret aircraft are tested. All Bob Lazar has ever done is repeat what other people had *already* claimed in the past. When it comes to the most fundamental test, that of Bob Lazar's claim to be an expert in engineering and physics, he cannot or will not demonstrate any such skill. When Bob Lazar describes the inside of a flying saucer, his description is spartan; okay, so flying saucers may not have anything much in them to see, fine. But note his total lack of curiosity, and total lack of remarks about things that should be remarkable, such as: \"Where is the toilet?\",\"Where does the air come from?\", \"Where is the door handle?\", \"Where are the storage compartments?\" The absence of such features should be of great interest, but apparently not to Bob Lazar. Bob Lazar has never seen the inside, or the outside, of a flying saucer. Also, his picture of the \"sports model\" saucer looks identical to the earlier one faked by Billy Meier."

Have you ever considered that people don't come forward with their reports of this phenomenon because of the ridicule they endure? Pilots more often than not do not report sightings or near misses with UAP/UFO's because they feel it would damage their reputations. The same is understandable with Bob, the ridicule he's faced and the attacks of being labelled a \"pathetic grifting scumbag\". The disinformation campaign has worked."

Bigelow then hired a couple people (Colm Kelleher and James Lacatski) to start looking into UAP in accord with the AAWSAP government contract. When Kelleher and Lacatski were interviewing for program manager, David Fravor was looking for a job... and came to interview for them (this was in 2008). Kelleher and Lacatski would go on to pen a few books about Skinwalker ranch with George Knapp. Bigelow and Knapp are longtime friends. George Knapp hosts the Weaponized podcast with Jeremy Corbell. Knapp and Corbell were both seated behind Grusch at the house hearing.

All that being said, Joe Rogan has repeatedly said that he knows more about Lazar's connection to MIT, and that it \"makes sense\" but also has something horrible associated with it, which is part of the reason Lazar doesn't really talk about it. I don't know if I buy that, but I am really curious what the full story is."

So there is no incentive or motivation to speak publicly, other than to get the truth and experience out there. There is no fame or money or prestige that comes with being a public witness. These folks aren't rollingkn millions of dollars in sensationalism. They are just regular folks who had an experience that legit happened. One of the hardest things to do, is to get people to listen. And I mean really listen. Like being in a band, it's hard to get people to really listen to your music. I think it's similar to a UAP or UFO witness.....the majority of people do not want to listen.

The question is was the vilification of him completely unwarranted or was he at least partially responsible for it himself, at least some of it. I'd suggest he answered that question in his response to this question. Possibly the single biggest day to date in the history of this topic and his first thought is strictly about himself. Before I get a barrage of downvotes not that that's a major consideration for me but I don't want to be misunderstood, I believe him. My only point is I think his own behavior which seems to be almost exclusively about himself brought some of this on himself by simply being unlikable at times. Hard to make a figurative martyr hero out of someone who comes off self absorbed and unlikeable. I'll concede if people had spent decades trying to discredit and harass me I doubt I'd be all that likeable but it doesn't contradict my first opinion."

Lazar has already been proven to be a liar: lying that he got degree from MIT: when, in fact, it was later learned that he only went to a community college: a place where people who aren't smart enough to get into college go after high school. And the community college was in California, not in New England where MIT is located. So this already points out two inconsistencies with his tale: he lied about his education, and he isn't smart enough to be a physicist: the physicist he said he was while working for Los Alamos Labs: the premier government-run Laboratory in the nation that included physicists who developed the atomic bomb. Someone not smart enough to get into a regular college would NEVER be hired to work as a physicist at this topmost research lab in the country. Besides this, he said element 115 was used for fuel in the alleged vehicle. Element 115 was discovered and synthesized a few years later. It was discovered it has a half-life of a split second - meaning it decays very quickly into a different element; so could not be used as a fuel. After this was discovered he gave the excuse that his alleged element 115 must have been an isotope of element 115 - a variant of an element with additional neutron(s} - that was more stable and long-lasting. This also points out that he was lying about working with element 115 - - - because its been well known for decades that mass spectrometers are used to detect what element(s) are in a material; and they always tell you what isotope of the element is in the sample; and that is always important information always included in the resulting description of the element. So, if he had worked with a stable isotope of element 115, that he gave the excuse it must have been - he would have already known that it was an isotope of element 115. But now, all of a sudden he says he didn't know that it was an isotope of element 115 - thats Obviously a lie, since any scientist who works with an element would know if its an isotope or not.So he's able to deceive the vast majority of people who don't have any scientific training. This, taken along with his lying about his education; plus that someone with a substandard community college education would Never be hired by the top research lab in the nation as a physicist - tells us that Bob Lazar an Absolute liar - but a Very Good Actor.."

And the community college was in California, not in New England where MIT is located. So this already points out two inconsistencies with his tale: he lied about his education, and he isn't smart enough to be a physicist: the physicist he said he was while working for Los Alamos Labs: the premier government-run Laboratory in the nation that included physicists who developed the atomic bomb. Someone not smart enough to get into a regular college would NEVER be hired to work as a physicist at this topmost research lab in the country. Besides this, he said element 115 was used for fuel in the alleged vehicle. Element 115 was discovered and synthesized a few years later. It was discovered it has a half-life of a split second - meaning it decays very quickly into a different element; so could not be used as a fuel. After this was discovered he gave the excuse that his alleged element 115 must have been an isotope of element 115 - a variant of an element with additional neutron(s} - that was more stable and long-lasting. This also points out that he was lying about working with element 115 - - - because its been well known for decades that mass spectrometers are used to detect what element(s) are in a material; and they always tell you what isotope of the element is in the sample; and that is always important information always included in the resulting description of the element. So, if he had worked with a stable isotope of element 115, that he gave the excuse it must have been - he would have already known that it was an isotope of element 115. But now, all of a sudden he says he didn't know that it was an isotope of element 115 - thats Obviously a lie, since any scientist who works with an element would know if its an isotope or not.So he's able to deceive the vast majority of people who don't have any scientific training. This, taken along with his lying about his education; plus that someone with a substandard community college education would Never be hired by the top research lab in the nation as a physicist - tells us that Bob Lazar an Absolute liar - but a Very Good Actor."

From there he used his connections and local news popularity about fitting a jet engine into a car. EGG probably scooped him to see if he could add a different perspective to the reverse engineering problem as he had a high recommendation from a very senior scientist. Separately, Bigelow, a billionaire who's worked with Bob, says Bob is likely telling the truth, even after bob fucked him over on lab space. I believe Bob has lied about his credentials to get to where he went, and I believe he does have issues with his past. But I do believe he was there and a lot of what he was saying was true, or something he overheard in a brothel/bar near a51. Reality is we don't need to vindicate Bob. We have Grusch.

Perhaps there is no visible storage at all, but again Bob Lazar makes no comment. Perhaps tools are produced as required, Star Trek replicator style by the ship and reabsorbed when no longer needed, but Bob Lazar offers no speculation and will not until someone asks him about it, because *he didn't think of it.* Bob Lazar is a man who defrauded his friends and his own family, so I have no difficulty imagining that he might tell lies to strangers to make money."

And the community college was in California, not in New England where MIT is located. So this already points out two inconsistencies with his tale: he lied about his education, and he isn't smart enough to be a physicist: the physicist he said he was while working for Los Alamos Labs: the premier government-run Laboratory in the nation that included physicists who developed the atomic bomb. Someone not smart enough to get into a regular college would NEVER be hired to work as a physicist at this topmost research lab in the country. Besides this, he said element 115 was used for fuel in the alleged vehicle. Element 115 was discovered and synthesized a few years later. It was discovered it has a half-life of a split second - meaning it decays very quickly into a different element; so could not be used as a fuel. After this was discovered he gave the excuse that his alleged element 115 must have been an isotope of element 115 - a variant of an element with additional neutron(s} - that was more stable and long-lasting. This also points out that he was lying about working with element 115 - - - because its been well known for decades that mass spectrometers are used to detect what element(s) are in a material; and they always tell you what isotope of the element is in the sample; and that is always important information always included in the resulting description of the element. So, if he had worked with a stable isotope of element 115, that he gave the excuse it must have been - he would have already known that it was an isotope of element 115. But now, all of a sudden he says he didn't know that it was an isotope of element 115 - thats Obviously a lie, since any scientist who works with an element would know if its an isotope or not.So he's able to deceive the vast majority of people who don't have any scientific training. This, taken along with his lying about his education; plus that someone with a substandard community college education would Never be hired by the top research lab in the nation as a physicist - tells us that Bob Lazar an Absolute liar - but a Very Good Actor."

Conversely, much of his verified employment and education, minus what he claims that just cannot be true, pretty much eliminates him as possibly working as a researcher for anything... much less a high level reverse engineering program. My theory on Lazar, based on the research done by Standon Friedman and others, is that he managed to work at S4 as a contracted radiation technician from Kirk-Meyer, which probably only required a secret clearance, as that is what he was doing when he was working at Los Alamos. I believe he ingratiated himself with some of the actual researchers there and found out some details about some of the work they were doing, but specifically the dates and times of some of the flight tests, which is what he was caught attempting to sneak in close and show off to his friend. I think believing he was about to go to jail, he took what he had learned and added some more imaginative details to and claimed to actually be a researcher and went to the press with what he thought would be a shocking enough story to gain traction. I think he thought that the government would drop their prosecution in order to keep from drawing attention to the program, which in essence worked. After that, he's just kept up the con since he figured he could make a few bucks on the side doing TV spots and selling his VHS tapes."

Its been known since Isaac Newton in the 1600s that gravity is a steady state field, that decreases in intensity with distance from a mass according to the equation F = G m1 m2 / r^(2) And Einstein's General Relativity published in 1915, confirmed to be correct in thousands of observatons and experiments, expands on Newton's gravitational field equation to make it more general: also showing that gravity casued by a mass is a steady field: not a wave. You are probably confusing gravity with \"gravitational waves\". A mass that causes gravity doesn't produce gravitational waves. Gravitational waves are caused by black holes revolving around each other - the combination of their immense masses and motion around each other produces gravitational waves"

The term doesn\u2019t come from 4chan, it comes from underground white supremacist groups. Kinda sucks cause it is a decent, like, term for something that does need a name. Also, you are using the term correctly and to mean the same thing. It\u2019s an inside operative like a cop or fbi agent and they\u2019re called that cause they\u2019re so obvious they glow.

Skepticism has always been the bedrock of this subject. Individual witnesses have financial and attention-seeking incentive to be dishonest as outside organizations have a history of lying and intentionally creating division. It feels like the newcomers do not appreciate that there are plenty of people who believe there is an aspect of the phenomenon going on, something here is real, and questioning new things is somehow a bad thing now, so my bad on being combative, im just used to this demonour online recently. Its worth noting, the majority of people who have been researching this subject for 10+ years do not tend to believe Lazar. Nonetheless a good place to start would be this \"debate\" with Stanton Friedman and Jermey Corbell. I think Corbell comes across childish and obnoxious here personally, but do not hate him like many do (not that this should matter whatsoever). I still keep the door open to the possibility that he's being honest, just lean towards him taking \"current\" ufo lore in the 80s and trying to place himself into it.

The part i think you\u2019re missing, or there\u2019s a misunderstanding, but among those that are skeptical about Lazar, they are not all necessarily throwing out the baby with the bath water. I personally believe there are legitimate instances of sightings/encounters and there has been a lot of good research for many years. Regarding this subject, it is best to always be skeptical. That doesn\u2019t mean don\u2019t believe anyone, but there has been a history of people caught lying (sometimes years later) and instances like what happened recently with Jacques Vallee. There was a pretty thorough debunking of the Trinity Case (from his most recent book), however I still hold him in the highest regard, and won\u2019t ignore decades of contributions. Similarly with Stanton, I dont believe the validity of the MJ12 documents myself, but still trust Stanton's decades or research. The more you research, the more deceptive practices you see, but also the more legitimate information you encounter as well . Don\u2019t assume someone skeptical about certain cases/people are just \u201chaters\u201d. This subject is far more complex and complicated than just 2020s disclosure talk, albeit very interesting itself. Ufos sightings did not begin with the Nimitz encounter, and people outside of Bob Lazar and Jeremy Corbell have been both researching and whistleblowing for over 50 years."

You are probably confusing gravity with \"gravitational waves\". A mass that causes gravity doesn't produce gravitational waves. Gravitational waves are caused by black holes revolving around each other - the combination of their immense masses and motion around each other produces gravitational waves"

I know multiple people who work at LANL and Sandia, during their time as PhD students up until now as physicists and engineers there.

National Lab positions for grad and PhD students are highly competitive. They are doing internships there before graduation, they are doing research for their programs (creating a body of work) to land these jobs.

Bob's education history has never been verified and he has been caught in multiple lies regarding his previous professors at distinguished universitys. The list goes on, but these are some I remember off the top of my head."

Engineers take those breakthroughs and refine them into useable products. You may know that the first microprocessor was invented by Intel, but you probably don't know that the first person to prove it was possible was Claude Shannon. His master's thesis proved it was possible to run a computer using Boolean logic. He went on to become a professor.

To quote wikipedia \"Knapp's earlier work has been recognized with Edward R. Murrow Awards, Peabody Awards, and twenty-four Pacific Southwest Regional Emmy Awards\". He was at the recent senate hearings. He broke the Lazar story, produced the documentary on Lazar that Corbell made and was on the promotional tour for the documentary. He was also closely involved with Bigelow and the skinwalker ranch. I would be surprised if anyone, well except for you I guess, who had more than a passing interest in this topic hasn't at least heard the name George Knapp."

            "body": "No. PhD in physics here. Firstly let's clarify a few things. There are two ideas about gravity. There's general relativity which is very widely accepted and was proposed back in 1915 and there's a proposed quantized model of gravity employing gravitons which we postulated in 1930. In general relativity a stationary object will have gravity but its effect is created by the warping of space time. However an accelerating mass (including rotation) *will* produce gravitational waves but this isn't how gravity \"propagates\". In the early 1920s, physicists, including Einstein, wanted a uniformed theory of everything. At the time quantum mechanics was being born and was the leading theory for everything except gravity over the next 50 years as we gradually unified electromagnetism with the strong and weak nuclear forces, creating what we now call the standard model. Gravitons were proposed as far back as 1934 as an extension to quantum field theory and have been largely accepted as necessary to the quantization of gravity to complete the standard model. Now wave-particle duality is one of the central pillars of quantum mechanics dating back to the theories infancy. So although Gravitons were particles, they were also considered waves and therefore yes, gravity would propagate as a wave and be described as such in various contexts. *However*, this was well established long, long before Lazar was born and would certainly have been described in any pop-sci magazine covering gravity or unified theory of everything which is common still, today. It's worth noting also, that quantify field theory has still failed to fully include gravity in any experimentally viable way and there remains zero evidence for Gravitons, currently. But we continue to try."
