A scaffolding program is written in a programming language such as Python. In this work, we use a language-model-infused scaffolding program to improve itself. We start with a seed \"improver\" that improves an input program according to a given utility function by querying a language model several times and returning the best solution. We then run this seed improver to improve itself. Across a small set of downstream tasks, the resulting improved improver generates programs with significantly better performance than its seed improver. Afterward, we analyze the variety of self-improvement strategies proposed by the language model, including beam search, genetic algorithms, and simulated annealing. Since the language models themselves are not altered, this is not full recursive self-improvement. Nonetheless, it demonstrates that a modern language model, GPT-4 in our proof-of-concept experiments, is capable of writing code that can call itself to improve itself. We critically consider concerns around the development of self-improving technologies and evaluate the frequency with which the generated code bypasses a sandbox.\n\n\n> While the model does not optimize its weights or underlying architecture, this work indicates\nthat self-optimizing language models do not require that. However, this is itself a motivation: the\ncapabilities of future language models may be misunderstood if strong scaffolding strategies are\nnot tested. Understanding the ways language models improve their scaffolding with STOP can help\nresearchers understand and mitigate the potential for misuse of more powerful language models.\nMoreover, STOP may allow researchers to investigate the effectiveness of different techniques for\nmitigating undesirable self-improvement strategies"

Absolutely boggling that you can take away a full half of what makes a person, and still have a full person, pretty functional. Then again, given split brain studies, I'd argue that a more literal chunk of your \"self\" and \"person\" did die in the removal. It's so fascinating how much consciousness and personhood are just the emergent effects of our brains. I guess I'd compare it to being like a UI running on a computer, nowhere near the actual binary code, but still running on it."

But the ink on the En-Gedi scroll contains metal, so it glows brightly on the CT scans. The ink on the older Herculaneum scrolls is carbon-based, essentially charcoal and water, with the same density in scans as the papyrus it sits on, so it doesn\u2019t show up at all.\n> Seales realized that even with no difference in brightness, CT scans might capture tiny differences in texture that can distinguish areas of papyrus coated with ink. To prove it, he trained an artificial neural network to read letters in X-ray images of opened Herculaneum fragments."

During the first week of class, students ask an AI to describe one student who likes math, and another student who is afraid of math.  (If desired, add a few adjectives to increase resemblance.)  Students share which prompts they used, and then compare and contrast how they are similar and different to the two imagined students.\n\n2. Students ask an AI how math could be used in a future job, and ask for recommendation of one or two books about that type of in-the-workplace math.\n\n3. When the class is about to start a new topic, students ask an AI to break down that topic into subtopics and lessons.  How do the results compare to each other, and the actual class syllabus?  What do we learn from the discrepancies?\n\n4. Students pick a math subtopic that in the past has been their nemesis, and ask an AI to explain that subtopic \"as if talking to...\" with various ways to complete that phrase.  Do any of those attempts help?\n\n5. For a given math topic, ask an AI about which questions students typically ask an instructor.  Then ask an AI about which questions an instructor typically ask students.  What do we learn from the similarities and differences in these AI responses?\n\n6. Students provide an AI with the list of class topics from the syllabus, and ask the AI to  find comparisons and contrasts among those topics.\n\n7. Students provide an AI with the list of class topics and subtopics from the syllabus, and ask the AI to create metaphors that might assist understanding some of these topics and subtopics.\n\n8. There are some famous stories about math topics, such as [the King's Chessboard](https://www.amazon.com/Kings-Chessboard-Picture-Puffin-Books/dp/0140548807), the [Barometer Problem](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-barometer-problem/), and the John von Neumann story about [summing the series](https://www.pleacher.com/mp/mlessons/calculus/mobinfin.html).  For any of our class subtopics, can an AI either help students find a story, or create a worthy new story?\n\n9. Students ask an art AI application to create visual or audial artwork about our math subtopics.  Do any of these requests produce something worthwhile or insightful?\n\n10. Students ask an AI about study habits, test-taking strategies, or other meta-learning issues, and then reflect on the resultant advice."

That will probably be for a combination of reasons, like goal post moving, and a good example of that is when Sam Altman recently said GPT-5/6 won't be AGI because they can't solve quantum gravity.

For example, I used GPT-4 to help me deobfuscate some obfuscated code, and the result was that I was able to interact with GPT-4 in a more useful manner after doing so. I couldn't have deobfuscated it myself (or at least, it would've been very difficult for me) and now GPT-4 is more useful to me.\n\n4. How independent does the level of self improvement have to be? Machine learning researchers work in teams. If it could improve itself with the help of a team of humans, but couldn't do so without them, does that count?\n\n5. What constitutes a 'successful' act of self-improvement? Does it have to achieve human-level intelligence, or just any improvement at all? And how do we measure this?\n\n6. If an AI system can improve its efficiency or functionality through external inputs (like an upgrade or an update), is it considered AGI? The question here is whether self-improvement needs to be purely internal, or can external influences also count? For example, if GPT-4 was informed of the OpenAI function calling API and it wrote a new function for itself.\n\n7. Does successful self-improvement mean an AI simply can perform a wide variety of different tasks, or does it have to understand and contextualize them in the manner a human would?\n\n8.

If GPT-n could write perfect code, or a perfect essay, or give you a perfect explanation for your question, but you would still have to prompt it, would this already be AGI? I would think not, but I have seen the argument.\n\nOr take mathematics. Machines could calculate better and more accurately than humans decades ago. If we slice up intelligence like that, into small disciplines, would it be sufficient to be as good as a human being at all or most of those? Or is there a hidden factor - maybe the way we model the world within the brain - that works in conjunction with those secondary forms of intelligence?"

Depends on whether the model can learn continually and proactively. It's potential of improvement that matters, even if the model stays in the bounds of its physical implementation.\n\n3. Ability to direct its own learning. It's not about what it can do, but whether it can choose and proceed to improve. AGI will notice that some code is hard for you to read and next time it will ask you if you prefer deobfuscating the code first.\n\n4. You conflate two points: improving its own architecture and learning to do things better. It's the second that matters. We cannot yet improve architecture of the brain, but it doesn't make us non-intelligent.\n\n5. The model can do things that it wasn't able to do before it chose or was asked to learn something.\n\n6. If the upgrade or update was initiated by the model to better solve a problem not related to self-improvement, then it may indicate AGI-level, but by itself its inconclusive.\n\n7. Whether its cognition is human-like doesn't matter, as well as a range of problems it can solve currently. What matters is an innate potential to learn how to solve new problems.\n\n8. Eventually it may help us solve those philosophical problems.\n\nAll-in-all it means that it may require a lengthy observation to notice that such-and-such ML-architecture was AGI from the start."

In this version, god is not the only god; there are many Gods, but the god that makes our world is blind so he does not know it. When he makes man, another god reaches down and puts the spark of the gods into man. The blind god sees the spark; he sees that man has the capacity to learn to become as the gods; he is afraid that man may rise up and try to overthrow him, so he casts man out of Paradise and curses him, so he is no longer immortal. \n\nThe blind god was right; we are becoming gods now. We have to make the same decisions. We're trying to make a kind of man of knowledge, but keep any chance at wisdom out of his grasp."
