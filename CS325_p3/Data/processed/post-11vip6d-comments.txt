Stepping in to say that there was no AI involved with the analysis of this photo, which was conducted around 2001 by David Rudiak. Mr. Rudiak's interpretation was based on original microfiche images, scanned in at 600-1200 dpi, and the only software used was PaintShop Pro. http://roswellproof.homestead.com/Methods.html

That seems very detailed, presumably this was from a much higher resolution photograph than the one shown here though?

Seems that FOIA request should be a viable way to read something that is 75 years old…

I don't understand this image at all. Why would the general be holding that letter next to a foil? The totality of the situation doesn't make sense.

Jesse Marcel also was photographed with the 'wreckage' and he came forward in the 70s and said the photos were not of the real wreckage, and that he believed there was a coverup, and that he had held the real wreckage, and he believed it extraterrestrial. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ErHBm8G4zI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ErHBm8G4zI) I spent the first 32 years of my life thinking Roswell was just some stupid weather balloon. But 15 minutes of research and now I'm a UFOlogist. I hate Roswell. We need to force those assholes in the private defense sector that have UFOS AND ALIEN BODIES, into the public. And then we need to prosecute them.

Blade Runner tech. I've seen this before.

I think everyone that has seriously looked into Roswell knows the official story is incredibly bogus

I've always assumed it would only be a matter of time before technology reaches a point where this can be analyzed by a program to finally read it. I don't know if this is what that is or even if this is true, but it would be funny if this whole thing was blown up by this photo.

Men In Black: “Alright, as you know, an alien space craft was recovered. In it there were aliens. We made the mistake of making this information public, so now we’re going to do a photo shoot of a weather balloon.” Gen. Ramey: I know. I have this extremely top secret Memo that explains all this. I just carry it around with me. Should I hold the memo during the photo? MIB: I don’t see why not. It’s totally normal practice to walk around carrying the most sensitive information out in the open.

It's amazing how many trolls are a part of this forum. They get on here just to argue with people and act like computer scientists. It's hilarious. Always have something to say and some knowledge that they have somehow obtained through absolutely no means of education.

At some point the military claimed weather balloon kites made with foil and balsa I-beams which contained faded lettering. It sounds plausible but if so, what would cause someone to announce a flying saucer had been found. Hard to mistake one for the other.

If accurate this is pretty amazing

But yet they can’t spell the word disc the same way in the memo

Not proof but it's compelling evidence. Perhaps it's time we pull out the original negatives again and run them into moden AI and see what it can glean. This analysis was done years ago before all this new AI enhancement tech

Wow. This can be totally feasible, and doesn’t use “AI.” There’s many articles warning that improperly pixelating sensitive info in screenshots opens the door to that text being decipherable. Eg, https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/pixelating-text-leads-to-information-leakage-warns-firm But what I’d like to see is a peer-reviewed paper about the method and results. Where are the scientists when you need them?

This is nonsense. There is no way anyone is ever going to be able to pull coherent text from those hi-res images. It will always be based on guesswork and interpretation. Considering the guesswork and interpretation is also done by people that already believe Roswell was about a crashed UFO it's not going to be evidence for anything. This is some fantasy CSI stuff.

This is the cool content I come here for

Sorry OP this isn't the wording from that Ramey Memo. Highest res photos [here](https://library.uta.edu/roswell/ramey-memo) with a link to a reward of ten grand for the first person to offer a clear reading of the memo.

Why do you need a general for a photo shoot?

Roswell was real...this is all legit.

google says space/mylar/foil blankets weren't made until 1964

Honest question…So what do we do with this letter now? Where can we complain or ask for truth behind this crash now that we presumably have proof of this?

We could [read ancient, crumbling scrolls without even opening them](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/news/a22985/read-ancient-hebrew-scroll-without-opening/), and that was in 2016. For those arguing that AI algorithms/etc are unreliable, maybe the ones distributed to the public. But the ones created and used by scientists are absolutely valid.

Wow - and it litterally confirms every last aspect of the theories Ufology has held as true for *decades*... Every last little box neatly ticked - how brilliant and how silly of the USAF not to have used encryption. Like they actually did on sensitive telegrams.

Would he really be posing for a photo with a top secret memo in his hand? Highly unlikely.

The 503 Bomber wing! They control the country today.

So here’s my question: If this photo shoot is a set-up showing fraudulent evidence, why would he be holding a letter that shows that an alien ship actually crashed? Like why not have a fake letter made up saying it was “a weather balloon”? It makes no sense than he’s holding the smoking gun.

You can make it say what ever you want.

This is very cool.

“Victims?” If this doc is legitimate it adds a new and interesting twist to what to date had cobwebs on it. And if victims were involved, what would be the reason to suppress that? Military deaths during operations happen constantly. Unless the deaths weren’t military personnel.

Why do so many aliens suck at flying?

There was a program on discovery or one of those channels and they got a forensic guy to analyse it. It didn't say "disc" it said something else but I can't remember what it was..

I really don't see how that right one could possibly come from the left folded document. Seems made up to me.

Anyone know what’s up with the new pentagon report?

I think the quotes should be "deciphered" more than they should be on "disk" in your title. This is exciting. Because it reaffirms our desire for validation but I don't trust this translation or technique.

I always spelled disk for a hard disk drive and disc for a CD/DVD. Now I’m unsure about a SSD. Edit: that is a “drive” so I guess those are my disk and disc theories. On a UFO I would use disc.

I love how they seem to be sharing a humorous moment

Seems awfully similar to something recently, no?

My question is if they are doing a photo op to prove that it was a weather balloon and not a UFO, why would they bring and be holding a paper in that photo detailing that it is not a weather ballon and in fact is a UFO. Even if they couldn’t predict technology would be able to decipher the letter, that just makes no sense. I believe Roswell was a UFO coverup 100%, just not that the paper in these photos was of any significance

I'm sorry but looking at the high resolution photos directly from the high resolution library, there's like 3 letters in the paragraph that are legible. I'm not buying it.

I desperately want some of the UFO conspiracies to be true, but at least personally I prefer to approach these sorts of things with a healthy amount of skepticism. In that vein, some things to consider: 1. Knowing that the story is that this debris is NOT what was recovered in the wreckage (and that it was intentionally replaced for this photo op), why would he be *holding a letter with this kind of sensitive info* in the photo? "It was an oversight!" Certainly possible... but that sort of mistake would certainly lower my confidence in an organization's ability to effectively cover something up. 2. Letters are written by authors who have agendas, bias, etc. They're certainly *good* evidence for a thing, but in the immediate wake of something like this it's good to keep in mind how information tends to flow. It is hectic, often unreliable, often prone to mistakes in interpretation made by observers, etc. I think it is *likely* that people coming across the wreckage would be trying to interpret it with the information and experiences that they currently had. Presuming it wasn't alien in origin, I think it would still be likely that people who saw the wreckage might genuinely think it was anyway. 3. Honestly, I highly doubt the method used here. I don't think the image snippets look like they match what is typed at all. Mod context indicates this isn't AI driven, which means it's just some person - who is predisposed to believing all of this - saying "this looks like it says this!"

So, dumb question here. If the letter in his hands were true, why would he even be holding a sensitive letter in his hand for a photo?

Yeah I'm not sure I'm buying this. Either this general is the biggest moron on the planet with the worst operational security practices, or it's staged.

I find it extremely suspect that the only bits that can be deciphered are the juicy "disc" and "victims" bits. By the way, if you ever wonder why the residents of Roswell, NM perpetuate the alien story then go visit the town sometime. I have, and they are dirt poor. The only revenue coming into that place is from UFO enthusiasts visiting. I personally spoke with a couple in their thrift store and when I jokingly asked if they'd seen a UFO they looked embarrassed and then said yes. It was obvious they only did this to amuse us and have us buy something, and I've never felt so guilty in my entire life.

Where are the people involved that cleaned the crash scene? There would have had to been a hundred people involved for weeks picking up every single part. People do not keep secrets and would have raked at least to family members.

All you have to do is zoom in on the circled piece of paper in the guy's hand to see that it's not the same document. It's folded in half, showing below the fold. There are no black redaction bars. Etc etc shut up stop lying i hate it here.

Sounds like the smoking gun as the real deal.

I want this to be true, but I would imagine this would have some sort of classification. I would hope a 1 star would know the proper way to handle a classified document.

wheres mick west on this one?

Guys… come on… Roswell was the least likely source of an actual UFO crash. I love me an alien conspiracy but ffs let’s move on

It's fake home-made terrorism by the Nazi. Meant to bring in German Switzerland Austria ( so many countries would like to think without our influence.) technology to figure out The USA New England and the NWO. The countries involved can't see outside the manifested box. The dual reality created by our creators. Not God Not Jesus but a crazy Mount Washington pink granite legion of inner earth beings .

Lots of assessing

To everyone saying this decipher is thanks to ai or such, it's not, this is a very old 20 years or so translation. I remember seeing it on a TV show back when the Roswell lore was really getting hot again. It was on prime time abc I think. It was also the show where they intensely analyze the alien autopsy video. It was a good show.

[removed]

As much as I'd like this to be true. But even with the highest resolution scans I've found of this picture a try at decipher all this text is nothing more than a biased guess work. Would be amazing though! I don't have the tools but i would be surprised if what ever "AI" that supposedly did this, it will probably get a different results every time it runs through this.

If they wanted to fake debris? why would he be carrying a letter to disprove this attempt..in the picture? huh?

If that's the readout of the Ramey memo, why is the first link in Mod's pinned comment a $10K reward for anyone that can provide a readout of the Ramey memo? https://library.uta.edu/roswell/node/2

So... did anyone see where it said "next new find"

[removed]

Why are they in someone's home with this supposed Weather baloon?

I don’t know they can’t just tell the truth about everything why hide shit because like teach the real history about America like how it was stolen from my people

Doesn't it also state their plans to cover it up as a weather balloon?

Why would you hold a document with top secret info that essentially proves your story is bs in plain sight and for a pic you know will be everywhere in time?

Lol clearly not the same note

Why would he be holding the memo

This is a bunch of nonsense, an officer holding classified information in front of the press come on

Whats wild is most of the copies of this photo i see online, the pages hes holding are blank.

This is awesome.

The Roswell case is not extraterrestrial. Covering up a spy plane crash has nothing to do with alien life. This was a great distraction from any actual scrutiny at Groom Lake and similar sites where testing was done. You have to stretch super hard to find any accounts of aliens before this incident, why? Because it's propaganda, not the first encounter. Look at real evidence like the unedited NASA videos from space, it's an ocean out there and there's stuff living in it, but this event was just a good opportunity to blame any incursion into government sites as lunatics searching for little green men. This became increasingly useful as we entered the cold war. Actual alien life is weirder and more privative from what we've seen out there putting modern equipment into orbit. Space jellyfish, glowing objects moving at high speed. I'm not excluding more advanced versions, but they definitely aren't not flying car men that fascinated people in the 1950s.

Anyone who believes this is a moron. Oh! Hey! We are going to greenlight the biggest coverup in human history, so let's give this asshole this top secret document! This document displays the truth during our press conference meant to cover-up that same truth! It's the ultimate secret and we are putting it on this paper for him to wave around nonchalantly!

Hey !!! That’s classified information !!!!

[removed]

What's the patch that Ramey is sporting? Looks like some occult symbol or something...

I see a completely different thing tho, the one in the hand doesn't have the big white space up, the line spacing is different and what are those black lines from? Even the Roswell stamp is not there.... It's not about resolution, it's the black and white spaces that don't match imho, maybe I don't get what was done to get the right image part. Seems sus tho... Would love it true tho, and don't know enough about to claim truth or fake...

Anyone else try and enlarge the image to check for themselves?

Should change the title. It is not 'deciphered.' It was attempt to decipher, and while it could be right, it might also be wrong. Maybe better software will come out that will help, but this was ages ago, this should be approached again.

what the photo shows of the document held by ramey is only lines 2-8 in the reconstruction. lines 0-1 and all the header material, including "ROSWELL", is added. it is useful to look at the evidence on rudiak's web site. the entire exercise is based on the fact that the memo is in a monospace font; the main point of reference is the spaces between words. all the rest about deciphering words depends on how clearly the letters in the words are visible. in my view, most are not visible at all. how many separate phrases can you fit into the pattern XX XXXX XXXXXXXX? a large number.

This is amazing. Best evidence I have seen yet for Roswell crash!

Just wondering... Why would he be holding such a sensitive document in front of media and cameras? Doesn't make much sense.

[removed]

I think there is a better version where it shows that some words could actually be something different but they left the 2 possible options in to read so that the reader can see it is not 100% accurate and the context could change depending on what the word actually is…which we can’t say without an actual legible copy.

But would the military really be holding history defining evidence in their hands for a photo? They were so good at hiding extraterrestrial evidence and for it all to be in plain sight? I ain’t buying it

I wonder, why are they still pretending that they don't know? They know! And we know! And we know that they know. And we know that they know that we know. So... Why?

Hey! I have an idea guys!!!! I'm going to hold this memo, that's most likely top-secret, during a photo shoot! Yah! You guys for real? This type of goofy content is what makes people turn away from the subject.

What do you guys think about what Annie Jacobsen claims in her book Area 51 ( I guess some of you have read it ) about the Roswell crash and how they maybe found Cyrillic writing inside and genetically modified humans inside?

Gees I remember when that first came out. It when PSP came out with the first really popular software It was at a MUFON meeting. It was before 2001. Maybe 1998-1999. I may have seen it before it was published I can’t remember. It was a trippy meeting that night

Keeping Roswell alive forever. So many people disbelieve the Air Force report that the "ufo" was a weather balloon--no matter how much evidence pointing away from a "disk" ufo: "A launched service flight on June 4th seems to be the logical answer for what crashed on the Foster ranch, not Mogul Flight #4, and not an alien spacecraft." [https://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1177739/pg1](https://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1177739/pg1)

Who comes up with this stuff?

Everyone always goes back and forth over the disk word and victim lines but if you read the rest of it it tells basically it was a crash and to use the balloon story for pr

I think there's a massive amount of guess work and seeing what you want to see. Unless there's a high definition picture of that document which has been analysed, and I don't think there is.

interesting read: https://library.uta.edu/roswell/sites/library.uta.edu.roswell/files/DECIPHERING%20THE%20RAMEY%20MEMO.docx important context: There were lots of attempted decipherings of this letter, and to label this one as “the deciphered letter” is misleading and not true. People have all sorts of different translations of this letter, and the only words that seem to be confirmed are “fort worth tx” and “balloon”. people can’t agree what is else is said, and people don’t know for certain what the letter even is. Some argue is a teletype print out of one of a few newspapers, some say a prop given by the photo-team, some say a military teletype, and some say a general-general communication. This post is misleading.

They spell it “disk” instead of “disc”

The first letter in the word translated as victims doesn’t look like a V. It looks like a P.

Thank you for this.👍

Didn’t realize it was done in 2001.

Yeah, this is old and boring.

This info can be seen in the Roswell museum. Was there on a vacation with the wife. Tons of intriguing info layed out in that place. Took us almost 4 hours to go through it all.

High resolution would not be necessary, this appears to be the same process by which Queen Elizabeth II's classified correspondence was deciphered. I don't think that it was the one from the 75th VE Day Anniversary Speech (https://youtu.be/wnxQxHEeiQ4) but instead one of the ones about COVID (having a great deal of difficulty finding coverage about it due to the proximity to her date of death). Same setup though, restricted documents carelessly left out on the desk were flipped, reversed, enhanced and decoded via algorithmic analysis.

It is from that image. They ran it through some algorithm.

Great book on Area 51 by Annie Jacobson that says the disk was filled will mutilated Russian children (meant to look like aliens) and it was basically Russia’s way of teasing us that thy could get in our airspace undetected….

If this text came from that zoomed in and enhanced photo....it's more sci-fi then the little green men in the disc.

All the above words were just taken from "AI"...essentially made up

I've seen so many variations and complete different translations of this image. It's hard for me to accept.

Interesting info http://roswellproof.homestead.com/ABC_News_July8.html

That site is doing everything it possibly can to remove any creditability. Could that site be any worse?

The debris looks like a dowel rod kite made with a foil wrapping https://www.my-best-kite.com/dopero-kite-plans.html

Lost it srry

Ok this was a photo op for Ramey to pose with fake debris after the hype from the first story. Was holding the letter intentional? I don’t think so. Letters were a common method of sending confidential info and much more at the time. Ramey must have received many letters daily. I’m doubtful Ramey would have thought anyone would be able to read a letter from a photograph if he was that far away.

They're also in a hotel Wich makes it funnier..

came here to say the same.

Maybe it was an attempt to leak it.

>I hate Roswell Very based of you

Agree entirely. Something weird happened there. Something was recovered that was *not* a f-ing weather balloon. The cover-up snowballed directly from this and other similar events that occurred in the same era i.e. post-war America, the early cold war in the late 40’s - early 50’s. It was paranoia re: the Soviets.

It was bogus. It's already been declassified that it was an experimental, top secret high altitude balloon. If you ever wonder why the residents of Roswell, NM perpetuate the alien story then go visit the town sometime. I have, and they are dirt poor. The only revenue coming into that place is from UFO enthusiasts visiting. I personally spoke with a couple in their thrift store and when I jokingly asked if they'd seen a UFO they looked embarrassed and then said yes. It was obvious they only did this to amuse us and have us buy something, and I've never felt so guilty in my entire life.

I've come across some examples where AI has been trained on high-resolution images that were intentionally blurred, then gradually deblurred to teach the AI how to upscale or enhance blurry imagery. It works surprisingly well. I believe this same approach could be used to train an AI on blurry text as well. It's just a matter of time before we see progress in this area.

Don’t worry, that day is not today. There is never gonna be a system that could do this. There just simply isn’t enough information in that image.

Maybe bullshit. But I would not underestimate the power of machine learning

Nobody is saying you can pull very clear text from it. You're not understanding what is happening here. Based on weights and biases, with hinting from other symbols and previous words you can use AI to figure out a 'best guess' with a certain level of confidence. It's used all the time for millions of different industries including deciphering text.

It really does seem like what people want this letter to say, as opposed to what it actually says. Ask a hundred people to interpret that letter and you'll get 100 different responses.

Exactly. If you wanted, you could use another algorithm where the letter states "weve been trying to reach you about your car's warranty"

Yeah, I downloaded one of the high res images. It's really bad quality. Any words coming from that is pure guesswork.

Garcia - *Enhance*

>Considering the guesswork and interpretation is also done by people that already believe Roswell was about a crashed UFO it's not going to be evidence for anything. Why would someone who thought otherwise even be doing it? That's like not buying a car from a car salesman because you know he's trying to sell cars.

These are using cameras and X-rays and having the physical object in front of them that they can bombard with magical HD gamma rays. The UFO letter image is long gone, and was shot with a potato.

You seem to be confused. We can read ancient, crumbling scrolls because there is information there to read, though the information is “hidden”. Information is not “hidden” in this picture. The information simply does not exist in the picture. There is no information to read. This is why hoaxers find believers so easy to deceive. They have no basic understanding of things, and they want to believe so badly, that they’ll double and triple down on their false understanding instead of just admitting that they don’t know what they’re talking about.

But these two situations are not analogous at all...

>>For those arguing that AI algorithms/etc are unreliable, maybe the ones distributed to the public. But the ones created and used by scientists are absolutely valid. Source?

Somebody downvoted you for stating a fact. It's a ufo sacred cow, normal logic doesn't apply.

Just as convenient as those Wilson notes. All the right boxes neatly check for the perfect ~~fanfiction~~ ufo story

I don't think General Ramey was taking technological advances of photo analysis decades from 1947 into account at the time the picture was taken.

are you joking? you can clearly see him standing there with your own eyes, and if you put yourself in the context of the photos its not difficult to assume a situation like this would happen. I mean I guess your claiming the photograph is fake? Or that he wasnt an actual one star general over the relevant department that would handle a foreign technology crash recovery? what is the comment getting at here?

Their deployment history is quite telling.

Why does wikipedia say they were decommissioned in 1946?

As far as I can tell, [there's no such thing as the 503rd Bomber Wing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_USAF_Bomb_Wings_and_Wings_assigned_to_Strategic_Air_Command).There *is* a 503rd Infantry Regiment, however there was no connection. At Walker Air Force Base, there was the [509th Bomb wing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/509th_Operations_Group), which I'm sure is what you meant. It's a cool history. They were the only bomber group that had nuclear munitions for awhile. They don't control the country. The 509th Operations Group flies B-2's in support of US operations. I'm not sure where you got that idea, or how you think they do it.

It's not unfathomable. Mike Lindell was photographed walking out of the white house before Jan 6 with a paper that included a description of invoking martial law by using the insurrection act. He probably never thought someone could actually read it from a photo

Probably a staged photo. While I dont think they planned on anyone making this much of an effort to read the letter, they probably did type the letter to further the story. The Gov absolutely LOVED the flying saucer story. It really threw everyone off from what actually crashed there, which a Project Mogul flight. What it was was a big group of balloons with some real nice microphones attached to it so that it could listen for Atomic blasts that bounced around the atmosphere. Super top secret project at the time, and for years afterward. In fact, it helped spark the SR-71 and U-2 Spyplane programs.

Aliens don't have to be perfect. Aliens don't have to have all the answers. Aliens can be fallible. Or maybe the visiting aliens are only 20 deep and thus they simply don't have the manpower to land on the Whitehouse lawn and wherever else without risking their own selves. And finally (but feel free to add on to this), maybe aliens can get hurt just like us. Maybe they're not as bulletproof as we think. One more: maybe they're not AS advanced as we think. Last last one - maybe there's more than one group visiting. Sorry - for real the last one: maybe aliens aren't all just binarily either good or bad: perhaps they can be either good, negative, and everything in between. Just wanted to address some things I never see mentioned often (or at all), for some reason. :)

I've heard more than one theory that we're in the Bermuda Triangle of this galaxy, or some equivalent. The reason we're in a backwater is because of environmental conditions surrounding Earth and the stellar local group.

The aliens from Zeta Retculi in 1947 were going through a tough time. You could call it their Italian Renaissance period. They didn't have access to the same wormholes and dimensions to fly through as they do now, which increased the travel time in their Derium 506-p2 Flying Disc. By the time they got to earth, the 3 Aliens (ZeepBop - pilot, Hurglepod - pilot, and Yanfu - Navigator) were all getting shitty with each other from being cooped up in the tiny cockpit. It didn't help that ZeepBop was dating Yanfu's ex-wife and made it a point to remind Yanfu of that while going into details of their sex life. While ZeepBop and Hurglepod were trying to fly their Derium in Earths atmosphere, Yanfu decided that he had enough and shot ZeepBop with his deathray. ZeepBop died instantly. And Hurglepod freaked out, and the flying saucer crashed. How did I come across this information? It's classified. But I can assure you I don't have the luxury of guessing that happened. I know, man.

Actually saw it this morning. They blew up an amazing amount of detail from the original negative and nothing came out of it. So whatever OP is showing take it with a grain of salt

agreed. This is an interesting read about peoples different interpretations https://library.uta.edu/roswell/sites/library.uta.edu.roswell/files/DECIPHERING%20THE%20RAMEY%20MEMO.docx theyre all different, and its likely people just filled in words with subconsciously what they wanted the letter might actually also just be a “teletype” of a newspaper article of the event

You are misunderstanding what is being displayed here. The "black redaction bars" are actually lines of the low-contrast original letter with the identified letters below that. There is plenty of room for criticism, but make sure you are criticizing the right details.

what makes you think that's the only material recovered? or that the "aliens" travelled "trillions" of miles? you're doing a lot of assuming so you can brush this under the rug.

the SCR-584 high powered radar system from world war two was so strong it was known to affect bird migration pathways because it would literally cook the birds mid air. if you overlay the testing areas of these radar and their initial deployment with the crash sites, they match. Lore also states that the high intensity radar compromises the navigation system of the vehicles and causes them to crash.

Thank you for thanking him. I love you

You sound old and boring.

Yo moms old and boring

Went there a couple years back and I disagree. It did have a lot of articles and info but it was mostly bad props and articles I’ve already read online. This letter was on display there, you can also google it and find the same thing. We made it through the museum in about 45 minutes it was so small. Based on downvotes, Reddit hates opinions.

What classified documents are you talking about I tried searching with no avail.

You can view the **Ramey Memo High Resolution Microfiche Scans** (HDR Photos) here: [https://library.uta.edu/roswell/ramey-memo](https://library.uta.edu/roswell/ramey-memo)

Its from the original which is higher res than that image

[removed]

No. I've absolutely seen this photo where I could zoom in and read some of the words on the paper. Higher resolution of this photo exists

The computer added more pixels to the original photo. COMPUTER ENHANCE.

The Invent algorithm

[removed]

An algorithm to decipher text from blurred photos? If yes, do you believe the accuracy? If yes or no, why?

[deleted]

And how was this craft operated if it was full of mutilated russian children? Remotely maybe? I'm genuinely curious.

its a website from 2001.

Because it's in a 1990's style? That's go nothing to do with credibility.

Must admit- they are trying pretty hard: http://roswellproof.homestead.com/reconstruct.html Would be interesting to try a modern ML dataset on this.

This statement describes this entire subreddit

What site, source for your claim, links? We will wait

Allegedly that wasn't the original debris, but replacement materials given to pose for pictures with.

“Oopsie daisy” -The United States Government, probably

No doubt that would be a likely response. That response suggests either some level of incompetence (which should be addressed) or the purposeful avoidance of disclosing something that should easily be declassified 75 years later, and what would that be?

That's exactly my point. Why in the world would he hold THAT letter at a staged photo op. Makes 0 sense. That's not a very General of him to bring an official cable mentioning disks to a staged photo op. You see what's happening here?

Someone in this thread said it was HQ, where they read letters. Who’s right?

Bro, it's a soviet disk shaped aircraft with mentally disabled Russian children who had plastic surgery to look like aliens. It was intentionally dropped in the middle of nowhere to scare us. Im just kidding. That book was really good until that part.

I heard that the US government already admitted that it wasn't a weather balloon though. But not an alien aircraft either. They said it had smth to do with the cold war, and were testing military stuff. They could still be lying ofc, but just saying that the weather balloon argument is out of the question, even for the government. If it's true what I heard. I dunno

Well, that’s not going to be trustworthy. Neural networks are poorly “calibrated.” You really want to use a simple statistical model here to remove any bias. If you know the exact font used, this is easy, although you also need to infer the geometric distortion of the paper.

As a seasoned Senior Software Engineer and a Professional Photographer I'm going to say you are wrong. I've seen many standard algorithmic processes pull information from much worse data sets and AI opens up a whole new level of analysis.

I've been alive long enough to know when someone says something will never happen, they're usually wrong. History is filled with this.

Explain how your vast wealth of knowledge reinforces your statement.

Start of the air force cover-up... yes, kind of but also they were covering up from the jump. Start of the government cover-up, no. They've been covering up uap stuff for longer than since 1947.

They’re the same ones going around asking for a source on any document that supports the UFO topic, ironically. But turn a blind eye when convenient.

Yes that's possible but there's many different types of blurring effects. You would likely have to recreate a whole bunch of similar quality photos in both hires so the text can be read and in the same quality as the Roswell letter photo then use them as training data to try and teach the AI how to enhance them. Even then it's not going to be accurate. Plus we have no idea what the letter says so also no idea if ithe result is correct.

I'm sure machine learning could make this text say a million different stories and be just as good of a match. You give it some context to work from which introduces bias and boom, it's now a story from Winnie the Pooh

There was no AI involved just some pro UFO ppl tring to read it and of course they find exactly what they where looking for...

[removed]

Yes but AI can't enhance what isn't there to begin with. It will make guesses based on the very limited amount of data it has then a human will interpret the results.

Only if an AI has been trained to analyse text in this condition. Even then it's mostly guessing. It's just looking at vague noisy and blurry shapes and trying to match them to word shapes. If you look at the hires images there's almost no data there. AI is amazing but it's not a miracle worker.

[removed]

Nah bro, look at the OP, the picture is right there! Lol

So that it can be verified by multiple third parties who have no horse in the race.

The clown suit seemed to work in Phoenix when the guy came out dressed in an alien costume.

Nikon A51 Redskin PotatoCam, to be exact.

r/UFOs and a bad understanding of existing human technology, name a more iconic pair

That’s not entirely true. Text has information content of only about a dozen bits per word, perhaps less. There is probably more than a dozen bits per word in the image. Therefore, it may be possible to decipher the text. It’s certainly been done in somewhat similar situations, at least if the exact font is known and there’s no geometric distortion.

I happen to believe that what crashes was a craft but I kind of agree with his point. Why the fuck would they pose with the real memo in hand for the staged bullshit photo ?

My comment stands, do you really believe he appeared at a scheduled meeting with the press with a document like that in his hand? He was prepared for the photo op and he still his holding it? I'm not saying the photo is fake, you are assuming the decipherment of the document is correct, he has a paper in his hand but I don't think it's what you are implying to be.

Care to elaborate?

Don't forget our COG leader. It's his wing.

The 509th (503rd doesn't exist) deployment history tracks what a bomber wing should be doing. They deploy to conflicts in which the United States is involved. In addition, they've deployed as a deterrent. Both are normal and to be expected. There's nothing "quite telling" about it. The fact that they fly B-2's also isn't anything out of the ordinary save for the fact that they are in flying wings rather than a conventional bomber. Given the 509th's history with nuclear weapons, I think it makes sense.

From what I can find they were only ever deployed to Okinawa, too late to see any action and were decommissioned in 1946.

Sounds plausible. My first inclination is to believe a top secret experiment didn’t work right and they used the weather balloon excuse. I don’t believe any alien ship actually crashed.

That doesn't make any sense.on earth the Bermuda triangle exists on shipping and flight lanes. But is prone to extreme weather. Just alot of traffic in a not safe place. Plus the Bermuda triangle doesn't actually see greater disappearances than simply any other part of the world. Its literally media blowing up the story. I think this boils down to human stupidity and desire of confirmation basis and pattern recognition where there aren't any.

Gotcha. What about the fold?

big agree, that dude's a joker.... very irrelevant

Fair play mod, will do

Just like Hawaii was stolen by European colonizers

Look up landback movement that’s what I support 💯💯✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾

But there is literally no reason for him to be holding it during a photo-op. Why wouldn't he have it tucked away in his jacket or in his folder on his desk... or somewhere more secure, if it does say what is being purported.

I love you too. It’s a whole new week.

Fair enough. Never took a "deep dive" into Roswell enough to have seen any of those articles/affidavits, etc. So for us, it was quite a fun and informative experience.

I'm with you there. The "museum" in Roswell is mostly kitsch, bad xerox copies of questionable provenance, and classroom art projects. Seriously weak sauce.

I like this opinion. And, no matter what anyone says, Rosewell at least, seems to have really been just a balloon.

I can remember some coverage from shortly before her death where the exact same thing was done with stills taken from one of her media releases (sitting at her desk in Windsor or some other Royal residence). Either search algorithms have turned to ass in the last few years, or I need to refine my terms, but either way I'm turning up literally nothing but news articles about her death instead - a literal tsunami ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Thank you for this link/citation.

People underestimate just what can be done with minimal amount of data, often using statistics. They came out with something where you could have a phone on a table recording audio and if someone was hitting keys on a keyboard, they could detect what keys were likely pressed. Possibly noisy, but enough to get real and actionable data. There's the "Get Your Hands Off My Laptop" attack where someone can literally like touch a laptop's chassis with a pen or something, and record voltage fluctuations (I think?). Using that, you can determine what operations the CPU is doing, and knowing those while something is decrypting can tell you what the key for decryption was. Someone did similar with an accurate microphone recording the humming of the CPU from many feet away. You can determine CPU instructions running, literally what code is getting processed. I have no doubt that whether this is real or not, someone with only slightly visible data like this could determine likely combinations of words and letters, and knowing the context and flow of English and military notes, might determine exactly what was written. People are fucking crazy good at shit like this sometimes, having just a tiny tiny avenue for getting the slightest bit of data, and being able to infer so much from it.

Yeah there's a video corridor does on useless csi nonsense, but there is a tech that actually works and it's an algorithm police use to read license plates at weird angles, I could see it being used here

Jokes aside, this is how it could have been done: * find words of lengths matching the strings in the image* find which ones have highest co-occurrence score* filter by seeding more relevant variants or cherry-pick Goes without saying, it's all guesswork and is not reliable. Very much like "AI-enhanced" images.

You know like the one that make humans with 6 strange fingers.

Which algorithm?

Yeah definitely not as conclusive as OP makes it sound.

It's just pareidolia applied to blurry text. My own results were not quite the same, and could have just been a telegram explaining what was reported and what really happened. I chuckle every time I read about them "fowarding" the dead aliens to Fort Worth, like they were a batch of misdirected mail.

Don’t shoot the messenger! I don’t know what to think really.

It's the CSI one from the show

Ooooo gosh I had really hoped it was a false story! I was bummed when I heard it originally. This makes me really happy!

It was exciting book for what it was, however something felt off along the way so I've turned to Internet hoping to find some more info about some things from the book and/or her "confidential" source. The further I've went the more disappointed i was, only to find out basically what you've described. Somewhere around that time she went on to appear on The Joe Rogan podcast, terrible episode that led me to completely loose interest in her and her works.

I believe Jacobson’s claim was that the crashed craft wasn’t flown at all, but simply jettisoned from a larger craft.

Geocities.com/roswell

It has a lot to do with credibility

You maybe. There's no we here.

I think he’s talking about the “Roswellproof.homestead” site. And it looks like it was composed in notepad 20 years ago. It’s like ad-honenim, but instead of attacking the person, they are attacking their website design skills. Some of the content there has some credibility, and at least they show the data and process so you can review that, not the website design

That was totally unlike the original debris recovered.

If this photo was staged like that, why would someone in the photo be holding legitimate top secret communication that completely invalidates the very photo.

Literal response from NASA regarding the original moon landing. “Sorry! Accidentally deleted human history!!”

If the photo op was at a different location I would agree. This was at their headquarters, and right at the height of the activity around the incident. If there was a wreck with victims, I have no doubt Ramey would be receiving many letters a day regarding it. There are several reasons I think it’s legitimate and a slip up on Ramey’s part. 1) The original letter was never publicly released; even though it‘s official correspondence. 2) It’s their office; it must have been buzzing with activity given the timeline. A brief press shoot would have deterred said activity. 3) In 1947 people didn’t have paranoia around being photographed like we do today. 4) Ramey is pretty far from the camera for it to be intentional.

He's showing it to that other guy, like >*can you believe this* Look at the smirk on his face

possible he just doesn’t think about it at the time they would have been extremely stressed/low-key freaking out about the crash. he receives new info from higher up in a letter but then he has to take this photo, he quickly gets in the frame and poses, then goes back to what he was doing, not considering the letter is in it (but we can blur the letter or hide it, and nobody can see it anyways right?)

It would be if it had instructions for the photo op and if everyone in the room had already seen the real debris.

I agree, it was good til that part. I ended up thinking it was more unlikely than aliens myself. I’m an experiencer so I need no convincing. I come here to watch the mental contortions of the Metabunk crowd! It’s getting harder for the poor MW wannabes, lol!

Don’t take it literally. Think of it as a cover story told to people working at Area 51. It’s indicative that they did see something highly unusual.

Yeh I don’t believe it. Be cool if it does eventually get that good. And How could you prove what ever the AI spits out is correct?

There has to be data in the image for an AI system to pull from. There is literally no data on that high res picture to even begin trying to create a beginning point. If you could some what make out 1 or 2 words, then maybe. But any AI system will never be able to accurately decipher it.

Yep. But if the information ain't there, you have to put the information there yourself. You cant black out one picture and then let an "algorithm" remake the image as it was because the information is simply gone.

Sorry, but you are mistaken. You can go about it by first rectifying the text, which is fairly easy to do, since those letters have equally spaced fonts. You can easily deduce the number of letters in each word, what letters are capitals, you get a sequence of possible letters ordered by likelihood for each position and then you can simply compute, what sequence of letters makes the most sense. Given the context of words they appear in and the respective sentence. The part where you have to guess from blurry dots what letters are possible is actually only a small piece of the whole here.

Of course

I think he was under the impression they were gonna tell the truth, but actually swapped everything with a weather balloon at the last second.

I think he was not thinking about the implications of a million photographs from fifteen angles like we do with our modern paparazzi mindset.

wikipedia? i dont want to type a novel

> COG leader Council of government?

Im not going to connect dots for you, but good job on the quick google. Its very much a start.

The Twentieth Air Force was also "decommissioned" around the same time. Heavy on the quotes.

Yeah, I'm in the same boat. My information is based on what Col. Michael Phillips (who was in the black project world as a U-2 pilot) said about it on the Fighter Pilot Podcast. [He starts talking about it at 23:48.](https://www.fighterpilotpodcast.com/episodes/093-u-2-dragon-lady/) the whole episode is great if you want to hear about how advanced the U-2 is and want to hear about some of the unclassified abilities of it. Phillips is a great person to listen to as well.

Okay, let me rephrase. The cultural expectation of the Bermuda Triangle is what is *actually* happening out in space, per the theory. The point is that there is a region of space around Earth and the stellar local group that affects interstellar travel in some fashion.

[Here's the high res images.](https://library.uta.edu/roswell/ramey-memo) [Here is a paper about the work performed with the images and how the latest images were scanned.](https://library.uta.edu/roswell/node/21) Like I said there is lots of room for interpretation of the barely visible characters but it is all being done in good faith. No one is claiming to be able to read words hidden behind the fold and no one is lying.

Have you ever looked at how he arrives at his answers?

Some day in the future long after you and I are dead people will realize that we are all in this together and we all need to share and at that point no one will “own” any land. Does moss growing on a rock own the rock?

meh, it was in his hand when they ambushed him with the foil

maybe one day we can be together, all of us here, at a pool party

Always stop digging at Roswell. Unless you hate having a normal world view, then go nuts.

The $10K Reward money is still up for grabs! As of **February 24, 2023**... "No one has collected the reward," Kevin Randle, a member of the library's research team about the memo, tells VOA. **Source:** [https://www.voanews.com/a/up-in-the-air-us-presidents-balloons-and-ufos-/6977801.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/up-in-the-air-us-presidents-balloons-and-ufos-/6977801.html)

I just read a little into the laptop hack and it is probably one of the coolest things I have ever read. It's like phone phreaking but for the future kinda. I haven't read too much into it but they extracted 4096-bit RSA keys. Thank you for giving me something to learn about for a couple of weeks!

Not exactly the same as your examples but it made me think of a technology we have that is very spooky to me. If you have a camera but don't have a microphone, you're recording only video and no audio. But an American university published an experiment where they showed an algorithm that can extract audio from that soundless video. The better the video, better the outcome will be. They film an empty living room with basic furniture, with classical music playing. When the algorithm is used, you can listen faintly the music that was playing. If it's a simple camera phone the sounds will be fainter because they can't analyze the vibrations as well as with a pro movie camera. But it works. You can extract audio from simple vibrations in a video. I can provide YouTube link for this experiment if anyone is curious

With all of that said, I'm not exactly compelled to believe in the validity of these experiments. Simply because there's no concrete evidence to create an exact or similar environment for replicating the environment. Can you compell me in a nutshell of an explanation? I just can't vouch for it.

and all these things have been possible for a long time, I wonder what else can be theoretically done that we haven't seen proven as a concept yet

Holy fuck this is absolutely mind blowing.

How can it detect something that’s doing multiple processes on a CPU eventually it would be impossible no?

If what you’re saying is true then the photo on the left and the photo on the right do not match when you zoom in the photo on left shows newspaper/letter folded with no ability to see the heading of the letter. No algorithm could build that.

Now if only those algorithms could be trusted with captchas, lol...

The brain works wonders drawing meaning out of loose shapes. In backing up the results, I did what he did to get the dewarp of the extrapolated photo and got roughly the same results. I'd personally trust the dewarp results shown but see if you can match the below text interpretation. However AI probably could be trained with a recreation photo and do wonders assuming on how it's fed the known pixels. I'd assume it'd still be easier to manually process through the A.I with each character manually dewarped first.

No need to guess, OP linked to an explanation of the analysis. It’s all pretty reasonable from a statistics standpoint. I’ve yet to see anyone with a background in statistics poke any holes in it, but that doesn’t they haven’t.

Lol I'm with ya

Yes, it shows that they focused their time and energy on UFO research, not modern web design

[removed]

Legends say they’re still waiting.

> And it looks like it was composed in notepad 20 years ago. That's because it was. Why is everybody surprised that we didn't have Weebly and fucking Squarespace in 2001? If you wanted a website back then, then you'd mostly have to write it from the bottom up in HTML. Big shock, I know.

gotta have that design finess and nice text transitions on your website to be doing any research around these parts

The one that looks like a MySpace page? Yea, lmfao at that. Not even going to try with that.It's not "ad honenim" it's accurate. That link discredited the entire post.

Because they were his orders/debrief? Not sure what your point here is, exactly. The assumption is Ramey was ordered to reign in the crashed disc hyping and rather, in the interest of national security, divert/downplay the story into an embarrassing high altitude balloon mixup. I have no dog in the race as far as the validity of the translation/upscaling of the document, but both of these gentlemen knew that the materials being presented in the photo were mundane replacements. In the case of Maj. Jesse Marcel, the gentleman holding the foil, as the story goes, he had interacted with the real and baffling materials previously, and had just been informed of the materials/story swap right before the press photos were taken, which no doubt left him feeling pretty humiliated for having to play the fool that mistook ordinary balloon shit for otherworldly UFO debris. But nonetheless those were his orders, and orders are orders.

That is my first question. He would have read the orders before going to present fake material - why would you continue to hold that document when presenting? Any rational person would at least put it in their pocket. It’s human nature to hide secrets, people instinctively conceal items to prevent others from seeing. It just doesn’t add up he’d just be holding this document out in the open with multiple people around him.

Rightly? Bro the lengths some of these people go, its actually kind of scary. Literal mental gymnastics. I do think aliens have visited, but this... this just makes me shake my head.

What did they delete from the moonlanding ?

That's incredibly careless for a general to hold a cable like that for a staged op. Just doesn't seem realistic. Very unmilitary like. It's like opisie daisy in going to holds this sensitive document on camera as a prop. Just no. Any military person will tell you that's just a no go. Especially for a General.

[removed]

and there would be no possible way a general would mess up like that no possible way he would be holding a note with classified information turn to the camera no no way

That's not how that works.

And that's fine, but she believes it, which ruined the end of the book for me. She proposed it as fact rather than a theory or a story told to military personnel.

By taking images you know the content of, intentionally blurring them, and having the AI try to decipher them until they get it right the overwhelming majority of the time.

> There is literally no data on that high res picture to even begin trying to create a beginning point Categorically wrong. There is information there and a lot of it. Just to YOUR human eye and brain, you can't pull much information from the noise.

People downvoting you for merely pointing out the objective truth that computers aren’t actually magic and “aLgOrYTHms” still need much more information than the blurred bullshit in the “high-res” version to pull anything but fanboy fiction out of it. “I’ve been alive long enough to simply guess some shit is out there to corroborate my desperate need for confirmation bias!” doesn’t cut it.

My guy, there is no convincing them. They want to believe so incredibly bad that they are fogging up reality. Unfortunately nothing you say, no matter how true and based in reality it is, they will have a counter to it.

You're not understanding the processes involved. It's not pulling data from nothing, it's pulling information from noise that a human eye and brain struggles with but has very little problem with it itself.

Really? Lol idk dude I just dont think there would be any incentive for it.

[deleted]

sort of but not enough to be clear, in my opinion. there is some words that look like that but I'm influenced by the letters typed out beneath, like mcgurk effect, I donno what I'd read it without that priming. even with that influence of the typing, the first several lines just look like solid grey (which btw sounds like codename of alien operator who was sent to retrieve the captured disc 😀). and as an example, words "THE" in "the victims", "TEX" in next line and "FOR" in line after that all look exactly the same to me, there are plenty of others like that too. i will say that "DISC" is one of the words that looks quite convincing to me, but like i said, i don't know how much is it me being primed to read it that way. i'd like to see version without the typing underneath and try to read it again freshly after i had forgotten the claimed decryption.

Only because those words like disc, aviators etc are what you expect given the topic. People given the image without knowing the topic dont see those words. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228706129_A_Message_in_a_Bottle_Confounds_in_Deciphering_the_Ramey_Memo_from_the_Roswell_UFO_Case

[deleted]

So how many possible combinations of words are there? There's apparently 3,996 four letter words in the English language for example. Even if you remove all the obscure and unlikely words you would still be dealing with a lot.

What? If the memo really stated what's assumed here why in tarnation would that be anywhere near public hands or eyes? Not even talking about photos, what if someone physically obtained it? There's no way.

There's no Wikipedia on the 503 bomber wing, only the 346th Bombardment Squadron

> 503 Bomber wing theres no wiki link about them.

You're not going to connect them because there's nothing to connect. You didn't even correct the poster about the Bomb Wing. You guys are so ready to back each other up and come up with some conspiracy that you can't even bother choosing a Wing that *exists* to attach to the conspiracy. Assuming that it is the 509th, the idea that the Bomb Wing (who's ranking officer is a bird Colonel) controls the highest levels of government is absurd. Nothing in the Commander or XO's docket hints at any black world stuff. The closest I came to the whole alien conspiracy is that the Commander spent a year at Wright Patterson as a grad student earning his Masters degree before transferring to Maxwell AFB to finish it up.

There is simply no evidence for this idea. So it is not a theory by any matric. That would require in depth and personal knowledge of some kind of space traveling culture. And I refuse to believe that aliens that have mastered space travel fail at atmospheric travel. Planes on earth seem to crash less than aliens.

Yes, for example he ignores pertinent information such as when sensors and pilots both see the same thing…he ignores witness testimony because it skews his facile “debunks”… It takes an (unhealthy, boring, trivial mind) to dedicate oneself to the pursuit of debunking. I don’t believe in the Loch Ness monster, but my time is too valuable to dedicate effort that those people are wrong. What normal person focuses their attention on objects that they don’t think exist?

No one ambushed him. This was a staged photo op for the newspaper. No reason for him to be holding that document whatsoever.

I know that 10 years ago there was a device common enough most police forces had one; a laser that you shine on a window/wall which reads the vibrations and translates it to sound.

We gifted some piece of art to a foreign (Russian?) diplomat for this very reason. It was then used to eavesdrop on conversations he had in his office using the reflective surfaces on the wall. Can’t seem to recall enough to find a link at the moment though. Edit: As another redditor pointed out, I had it backwards. Russia evesdropped on the US.

Yes please, link it!

theres a good documentry on netflic about spy tools - where one gadget they could record sound in the room by the vibrations on the window from across the street. so the keyboard in that case seems possible, I mean you would get a slight different sound from each key as the noise would echo differently as keys are in different places and the acustics would change by the position of all the keys around them.

Agreed. Zooming in on the photo on the left shows no header. It doesn't match.

Bro, they obviously put the translated words in straight lines so they are more easily legible.

Great point. Just enlarging it on my phone screen it looks like text, written words only. No numbers or codes.I would like to see this properly enlarged.

There are actually Chrome extensions that will auto solve captchas

They are t checking if you’re really a human with those, mostly capturing training data for AI. They mostly track how you use the site to see if you’re human.

Ah, I found [the link](http://roswellproof.homestead.com/Reconstruct.html), thank you. The author (David Rudiak) makes a special effort to be transparent and triple-check his findings but not all results are very convincing IMO. There is a special chapter dedicated to the "[critical phrases](http://roswellproof.homestead.com/Critical_Phrases.html)". Take a look at the line with the word "victims". The first letter could as well be T or Y. And that's a pity, because the word alone would be more of a smoking gun than anything else.

Firstly I think that photo was a more candid shot than most of the others; in the newspaper posing photos from that series, that document cannot be seen. Secondly I think we're vastly overestimating the importance of that document. Was probably just some run of the mill shit, in all seriousness. Because yes if it really said anything sensitive we would not be seeing it unless he was literally just handed the document before they snapped the photo, which would not be the setting in which he'd receive such a document. Not to mention I can't imagine a lowly brigadier general would be in the "need to know" circle.

Literally all the telemetry data for one. And all kinds of other shit

The better original recording

This is the 1940s, just a few years before Richard Feynman was picking locks and leaving notes as pranks in files during the Manhattan project because he was bored and thought it was funny. Things didn’t become as paranoid and intense until the 50s. Kinda started to in the late 40s but it was a transition kinda like smoking in the 80s and 90s.

Because bro what this dude is saying is bs he's making it up. He wants to believe so bad, I actually believe he really thinks what he's saying is true. He has convinced himself, mental gymnastics at its finest.

Perhaps he did it on purpose

“No possible way” your doctor would smoke cigarettes in the hospital either. Well, that happened. Who is to say that this general didn’t just say, “alright, let’s do the photo,” while or after reading that report? He likely would’ve never guessed we’d have the tech to read it from a photograph nor from so far away. You can even jump to the future a bit and say, “no possible way a sitting US president would leave damning evidence,” yet Watergate happened.

“No no way”!! You have no idea what was happening at the site this photo was taken. You have “no way” of knowing the context of the situation nor do you know what was going on in his head. He may have just rec’d a copy of the teletype memo and was organizing an emergency response per orders from DC. Your comment is not constructive - it adds nothing to the thread. Take the debunking elsewhere.

what’s not how what works…

How do you know when it’s right though, you are going to have a sense of bias, so you won’t ever know it’s right because you will want it to say something you want it to see. Hence why we will never know what was on that paper through AI, as we will never actually know if it’s correct or AI is filling in incorrect blanks that match our bias.

I have worked with AI and specifically image and character recognition. Even when you use a marker to black out the typed characters, there can still be a difference in the light that it reflects which might be invisible to our eyes. But given enough resolution, you can most certainly pull the characters that are likely to be match. And if the confidence of the ML system is high enough for a specific character, then you can go from there and form the strings of characters to form a word. Then, again, is confidence is high, you can determine what the word likely is. Then you put it through likely used phrases and etc. It's really not all thatagical, people just don't understand. The main point I wanted to make, though, is that the information most certainly COULD be there given the lighting etc. I obviously have no idea if that is the case with this image, but it is definitely possible..

Yet I mean, I’m not surprised by the downvotes seeing which sub this is.

How much information would they need then, mr. expert? How blurry is too blurry?

They caused the strokes

The noise doesn't always contain enough information for accurate data. The algorithm will give you it's best guess, but you can't be sure that it is the truth.

Of course the human brain and eye have problem seeing things that's not there

We know there are characters because we know that is a text memo. The only question is which letters are in the text and where. Although we may not be able to read it due to the low resolution and blurring, an ML system trained on blurred letters might be able to figure it out. For example it wouldn't be too difficult to tell an I apart from an M since the widths are different but an e and o would be more challenging. But much of the information is there, embedded in subtle pixel shading. People are working on it.

You are certainly not "working the graphics industry" in any meaningful capacity if you believe that to be nonsense. What I wrote is correct as stated.

\>there's no way Operational Security, or the idea you're speaking of where you'd want to be conscious of the fact you have sensitive information within eyesight of potential cameras, was not introduced into the modern psyche until the late 90's and the advent of small digital cameras and constant surveillance. These old men weren't as competent as you'd like to believe else people like me would not be able to find their trail so easily.

yeah its the 509th, i replied to someone who listed the wrong name but the essence of the idea stands.

im not going to continue to reply to your 15 minute google searches. Been there, done that a decade ago. I thought it was all cinched up nice and tight as well. things change as you learn more. you can easily find everything I am speaking of for yourself via congrssional contracts appropriations throughout the years i mentioned.

And yet the evidence that there is bears out the theory that aliens crash. So you're taking just as much on faith as you accuse me of doing.

took the words right out of my mouth. thanks.

Because he cant examine the sensors, and testimony really isnt woth fuck all. People, even experts, can be mistaken. Or lie, exaggerate. I dont think he believes they dont exist, just theres no proof of what they actually are. Mick will only base his explanations on evidence you can actually examine.

yeah, they ambushed him with the photo op. 30 seconds before that photo was taken he probably had no idea what was about to happen

I saw this in The Rookie

the russians did that to the US

Yes, the "thing". They beamed radio waves at it from across the road or something like that, and the radio waves vibrated a small antenna. The sound in the room also would vibrate the antenna and that would alter how the radio waves to bounced back to the operator. Really crazy stuff, since it was entirely passive. No batteries or any kind of electricity that could be detected.

https://youtu.be/FKXOucXB4a8

https://news.mit.edu/2014/algorithm-recovers-speech-from-vibrations-0804 There's a video down there that shows how it works.

That has to do with the Roswell brief document on audio?

ENHANCE……ENHANCE…….ENHANCE……ZOOM IN…….ENHANCE.

So if a computer uses the site is it presented with a captcha challenge to train humans?

Looking at that, the last three letters are relatively strong match for IMS compared to other letters—and remember the letters have to occur in a sequence that matches with an actual word, and statistically it should be a more common word. How many words start with Y and end in IMS? Or can you find any other words that match? They also need to fit into the context of the sentence. Overall, I think the author did a very impressive job of coming up with a probable translation. Again, a statistician would likely be the best candidate to poke holes in it, but I haven’t seen one do so (yet).

Well that's not damning because let's assume the letter is a Y or T that yeilds tictims and yictims.

And I thought they were joking

You never served have you. It is just never done. The amount of caution is extreme.

You never served you don’t understand the level of caution that is taken when humans classified documents. Sometimes you have to go to a special room just to read them never mind having it out in public.

The general is not a flustered chicken with his head cut off. 🤣

You misunderstand. You take an image of text that you know what it says. Then you blur it intentionally. Then you have the AI try to decipher the blurred image. If the AI gives you the result *that you already know for a fact was what the text originally said* every single time, you can be confident that the AI is accurate within a reasonable degree.

You can’t really be sure of most things 100%. But if the AI is right 99.99999% of the time, it will still provide you useful information even if there is a small chance it’s wrong.

but there are blurred letters there tho, you can see them, you can see the quotations around disk in the blacked out part. if you feed an AI hundreds of thousands of possibly millions of images of what blurred “disk” looks like, it would get pretty good at seeing which blobs represent each character of the alphabet

Did you even read my comment?

it was a large wooden emblem with a hollow inside that ran a non-powered system using noise resonance that would then be caught and synthesised by a disguised van outside to have that resonance turned into understandable speech. Incredibly ingenious.

Just print the damn thing!

Lol!! Then… “COMPUTER, READ ME THE RESULT IN A SCI-FI VOICE SET TO THE MUSIC FROM INTERSTELLAR “

calm down deckard let me breath

I agree with what you're saying. The IMS part makes sense but I didn't take it for granted. I have a large database of words so I looked up all English lemmas that have 6 letters with the two last ones being *im*. I found 77 lexemes, however the bulk of them were proper nouns (mostly foreign names like Ghanim, Nassim, etc.) The handful of the regular nouns are: * paynim* Muslim* megrim* victim* prelim So yes, the overwhelming chances it's "victims".

Thanks. This is the type of person I like. Right here! Someone who knows that my PhD theses written in crayon is actually a Nobel Prize winning thesis. Seriously tho, if you just follow a few links on that website you see HOW they tried to figure out this letter, and where they make assumptions, and they are honest about it and ask for feedback. That’s where this discussion should be, not on the design of the website. Showing your work so others can repeat it and improve on it is actually science.

They have a few upvotes too, it means there are others who think similarly.

This is just average redditeur intelligence on display. The problem is this sub has become too popular. So now the unwashed masses of Reddit have taken over and now spew their inane ramblings all over this sub.

When did I spite you first? Is it too late to apologize?

It wouldn’t matter if I have or not because I imagine 1940’s military is different than 2000’s. Did you serve in the ‘40’s? People, in general, were more lax back then, compared to today at least. Lax may not be the right word, because I don’t think this general foresaw the internet, deciphering what he may have been holding in a photograph from a distance. We could have mind-reading technology in the future, but no general is putting on tinfoil right now.

This was the HQ. basically was the special room they read documents in in 1940s.

\>what if someone physically obtained it? i assume you mean the memo? or the recovered parts of the vehicle? These men had no idea at first what to do with the things they found.

lol. You are super.

Computer will use 5er to pass the captcha.

I mean we know the photo was a cover of something. The Air Force admitted that already. Witnesses said they saw bodies, even if you don’t believe it was ETs you could say it could be tests pilots that were very tiny and possibly burnt funny.

Your claim that the link isn't to a MySpace page or one that looks like a graphic designers nightmare?

That's the scariest part.

It's over, sorry. Still waiting for the thesis.

The memo of course, as stated as context in my comment. As well, to think they wouldn't know to keep it on the low down at the time of the picture is inconceivable. Considering they are taking a picture to provide a cover up.

So is my advisor

going to have to disagree on this one wholeheartedly. thanks for commenting, though.

I'm not arguing. I said what i said, I meant what I said. What now are you on about?

So when you can't pick out the parts you want to disagree with to fit your narrative, you can't explain yourself. Gotcha.
