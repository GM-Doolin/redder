Maybe it’s their actual baggage, like each alien had one carry-on, and one personal item for under their seat

&#x200B; Link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRO5jOa06Qw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRO5jOa06Qw) He mentions that these NHI might not be that much advanced but they took a different path in the tech tree, and he speculates they manipulate space-time with something akin to the Alcubierre Drive He also says he has no info about Bob Lazar, he wasnt on the scope of what he was looking into and if Lazar really has had some experiences he(David) has no clue He talks about time and how it might not be linear as we perceive it, when talking about the nature of reality he goes on to speculate that there might be higher dimensions "casting shadows" upon our reality, just like we cast 2d shadows on surfaces Alcubierre Drive: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre\_drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive) These are the points i found interesting, the conversation goes into speculation about anti-gravity tech, spirituality, realtionship between nukes and UAP, time-travel, etc It was disappointing he didn't put and end to the Lazar story (either way), i would asume he's able to confirm if some of what Lazar talked about is true or not, he says he wants the truth out, well he should get all of it out

A "different branch of the tech tree" idea is speculated about in the short story The Road Not Taken. It's not a long read: https://eyeofmidas.com/scifi/Turtledove_RoadNotTaken.pdf

In this clip from [Jesse Michels’ new interview with David Grusch](https://youtu.be/kRO5jOa06Qw?si=DbfkGXoURvVjakeS), Grusch explains that he wants to say the bare minimum to propel disclosure, citing that it is not his job to release the more important details. Grusch continues by saying “some baggage is coming” in relation to the non-human biologics he has previously mentioned.

My biggest take away came from the last few minutes of the full video. I believe he knows as much as anyone that’s ever been willing to talk about this stuff, and he seems…at peace, almost excited. I needed to see that, if I’m being honest.

From the way he said I think he was hinting that for us to understand the biological aspect of that our whole paradigm of reality is going to have to change. We are going to have to accept that we are 100% being visited by creatures from another realm. Once that cat is out of the bag it is going to be hard to get back to our regularly scheduled programming

I wonder, if the NHI are extra terrestrials, if there’s an alien whistleblower on their planet talking about us in the same way our whistleblowers are talking about them? Or, perhaps they have achieved disclosure on their planet, and everyone knows about us humans.

Woah, I didn’t know there was a new DG interview. Will be watching promptly.

Dude is trying SO hard not to slip up and say something

love the tanline on the wrist, guy is an intelligence worker through and through, removes his watch when he’ll be on camera

I'm still not through the interview, but his mention of Robert Sarbacher and Oppenheimer was interesting. I looked up Sarbacher, and one of the first things I found was a letter in which he confirmed UFOs are real, there is a recovery project, he knew Von Neumann was involved and believed Vannever Bush and Oppenheimer were as well. It's constantly astounding to me how many highly credible people have come out and said this, and we just didn't believe them. Link to the letter: https://science.howstuffworks.com/space/aliens-ufos/ufo-government10.htm

The baggage might mean we killed them, or they have integrated with human dna.

When I think about Commander Fravor deciding to take lead on the unknown and choosing to engage in a direct intercept with something like the tictac (the man literally played chicken with a ufo and the ufo blinked first 😮) Or David Grusch risking everything in his life to speak truth to power purely off the strength of his moral/ethic code and to be the leader and public face for all his peers so that they don’t have to take the same risks if they are afraid. It makes me amazed at the bravery that some humans posses

Wait. You all are too casual about this. Did I miss something? Who is this interviewer? Why was he chosen? Is this Grusch doing what Cornell said he would?

I've always operated under the assumption that competition is necessary for evolution. Where I think I went wrong was assuming competition has to be between two different intelligent participants. However, there are possibilities of a single intelligent lifeform competing against a dynamic and indifferent, hostile environment. Imagine a species that has made it to a similar point as us but has no concept of war, hunter/prey, or even violence. We have expended an immense amount of resources on simply getting better at killing things.

We just watched...I have to watch again. Him being on the spectrum answered some questions for me on the cadance of his speech, which I thought was odd. It actually gave him more credibility for several reasons to me. The point when they are discussing the frog in the faraday cage I couldnt tell if Grusch rolled his eyes or didnt know what the heck he , the host, was talking about

Thing I found of most interest was the deep dive in to the beginning of the uap topic and the scientific community that started all of this secrecy. There is a clear indication that a lot of scientific theory could have been manipulated by people wanting to slow down our overall progress in science. It would explain why we have not had a lot of progress in the energy sector and that there is a lot of research that has been hidden that would further our understanding. Hoping even more the Schumer bill passes so we can finally get past all of the distractions and get a clear view of the things that we have been asking questions about forever.

David is looking relaxed and I'm kinda happy that he is in a good 😊 place now. Glad that this is happening. Take my upvote!

At this point, it's obvious humans are being portrayed as stupid and that we cant handle it. The sad part is that other humans decided this us for us

Hmmm one thing that was revealed to me in this interview is Grusch said that during and after his investigation, his assessments were to go to the Deputy Secretary of Defense and Congress. Now I knew that Congress knows a *whole lot* more than they feel comfortable disclosing to us so far, but what I didn't link together is Christopher Mellon was the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense on Intelligence during the Clinton and George W. Bush presidencies. I knew that Mellon has some incredible information on the subject, however being the assistant to the Deputy Secretary of Defense himself, he probably knows pretty much everything.

Wow! The bizarre amount of negative comments here! I watched the whole interview, he struck me as a very balanced, level headed and trustworthy guy. All the comments here claiming otherwise, saying things like "I don't trust his face", "obvious grift" are just trying to plant seeds of distrust and create noise.

this whole video wasn't filled with a load of new info, but it was really nice seeing Grusch just hanging out and chatting and being himself. made me smile is all.

My theory on the baggage: The (or some group of them) NHI are the custodians. They've helped guide our evolution and the evolution of this planet. That concept alone is pretty mind blowing, let alone the follow-up questions, like why or for what purpose.

To those of you saying he should say more; maybe you should listen to Corbell and Knapp more, even though you ridicule them too! If he says anything more than he's been approved to say by his lawyer(a literal former ICIG) and the pentagon in general, then he WILL get arrested, and his whistleblower status will be stripped from him. Just shut up and be patient..

With "this baggage", I wonder how much of this ties into our concepts of self or even life/existence. Something like life/death or consciousness are not as we'd initially assume/expect, or that we ourselves are derived physiologically from these biologics, would only be the kind of thing that would really upend human society in a substantial way - e.g. refuting established religious dogma akin to the Copernican model/Darwin and Evolution. Exciting times we live in lads.

Holy shit that was a great two hours.

“Some baggage” I’m sure there’s “some baggage” that comes with auditing the Pentagon’s financials too, doesn’t mean it shouldn’t happen immediately or as soon as possible.

Currently watching and im loving it. Glad to see Grusch back

I wonder if the baggage from the biologics is something relating to how in America (and most of the world) we're an individualist society and these beings are likely more of a collective society, they are probably going to tell us we need to change and it's more of a demand than a question, but who knows

Does this mean there will be more hearings or possibly announcements? Would be cool to see them doing offical press briefings on this stuff.

Ive rarely seen so many comments about a persons looks. Seems Like the us gov. And their Lemmings are spending Work time in Reddit again.

I read it as "it's not stored in a Indiana Jones warehouse sitting in a crate" but actually stored and researched within corporations that would have some explaining to do aswell about their connections to deep government and taxpayer funding while withholding potential world saving tech/biologics

Man they are coming out of the woodworks to talk shit about him. Imagine if your job was to talk shit about an exemplary example of a human being on Reddit? Pathetic. Edit: thanks for proving my point comments below….

This sub is compromised

Grusch clarified something that's been bugging me for a while: "Why he can say some specific things and not others". It turns out that those specific things is what he submitted for DOPSR review. He might get clearance to discuss other things, but he would need to submit a new DOPSR, but he said is not his job to disclose everything. He just gave away the important stuff as a starting point. Makes sense.

These comments do not pass the vibe check. If you’ve got nothing nice to say, maybe you should shut your mouth and divest yourself of the topic. I’m not saying this to those who are critical and ask questions, but those who are outright attacking him personally for his appearance or no good reason. Comments talking about his weight and character are utter garbage and should be shamed.

The baggage is that the bodies contain human DNA, mixed with something else that's going to be "sobering" and its going to also introduce some questions about what it means to be human. Its also going to be an interesting discussion about how we get a mixed breed being! That's the baggage

By baggage I think he means the stigma and ridicule that would come with something like saying "non human biologics."

Wait till the baggage comes out of the bag that we've never been alone and this has long been a colony

Watched half before bed. Can't wait to watch the other half. I'm one of the believers who wants to see the evidence, but this interview (so far) is great. Even though he hasn't released new information or evidence I'm really enjoying him just talking about what he's already mentioned. But I'm really enjoying the extra theories that he goes through with the atom and bombs, different technological pathways taken.

I’m so glad to see him looking well and speaking out more!

"Sort by New" and be baffled by the amount of trash comments/bots that are operating in this thread ATM. Jesus.

Just here with 🍿

The "baggage" related to biological could be we've been cloning and killing aliens for years as part of the reverse engineering process...and giving them access to human "biologicals" as well...an eye for an eye.

His thoughts on the warp drive is interesting. There must be some vehicle debri or intact craft he is aware of that is shaped similar to a 'biblically accurate' "Throne." Those things that possibly took that plane looked as if they could rapidly bend space around them as needed. This NHI surely has multiple kinds of entry vehicles into our dimension...

Only thing I think it can be is shared DNA. Anything Beyond that feels like it requires mind melding or telepathy or something… That NHI shares our DNA will be fucked up, and it’s also something that we can probably reliability figure out

The really important part is that it has gotten nearly half a million views in 17 hours. Keeping this in the minds of the population is the most important thing any interview can do.

Grusch is built like a TANK lol. How tall is he? At least 6 foot 4 and 250 lbs I think.

Wow, whoever is mobilizing all these bots to bash Grusch is doing a horrible job. It must just be some troll, I refuse to believe the USG is this incompetent.

It was much better than the News Nation interview, even if there wasn’t that much new info. I hope we can find the truth to this mistery in our lifetimes.

No idea about the contents of this interview but the video confirms a comment I said months ago - I hope those threatening Grusch are armed because he's an absolute unit and I imagine could fuck some cunts up if need be.

Biggest things I learned: NHI = sentient beings with body’s and minds, and they are what we would call pilots (so can the trolls stop saying it is bacteria or dead cows or whatever the hell lol) Also, “ontological shock” is in regards to “what happens after death and are we alone in the universe” and religion was a part of why the oldguard MIC hid things

Can we watch the unedited interviews somewhere? I'd like to hear what Grusch has to say without constant interruption.

Just like Corbell said, Grusch was about to be unmuzzled and we may get information in other ways besides hearings.

The way he talked about Oppenheimer has me thinking that MJ-12 might be confirmed.

My thinking is that the reason that they are extra dimensional and are interested in basic geometric shapes is because these are the most basic shapes that you can create in a 3D world. And with all this talk around inter-dimensional beings (or rather extra-dimensional beings), the likelihood may be (if you consider the holographic principle Grusch touched upon), that this is the only way in which they can transfer knowledge to us as inter-dimensional beings; in a way by which we can perceive it. This is similar to how, if we were to communicate with a 2D world, we would have challenges, but we would have to make ourselves known to them in a way by which they can perceive meaning from what we are trying to demonstrate. Does that make sense? All these basic geometric shapes; prisms, cuboids, spheres with cubes in them, all of these things are basic 3D geometric shapes with a lack of complexity I think Crop circles are the same sort of thing too, attempts to communicate with us in a 2D landscape using basic geometrics

God bless David Grusch.

UFO sub full of people who absolutely hate when people talk about UFOs.

Full interview link anyone?

The baggage is obvious, oil is the culprit that has enriched a few, perpetuated our industries but has poisoned our air, water, environment. The aliens have technology that would do away with all oil use an create a free energy source for everyone.The sticky part is our economies are all interconnected and the true few who run our world are resistant to this change. Thats why the NHI 's have put a clock on disclosure. Their interest is the universe and they are stewards of our planet. They are telling the elites the the party is over. Come clean with your people cuz we're coming whether you like it or not. The elites will try to fool us into believing that the aliens are bad. Don't fall for it one bit.

AWESOME, glad he seems to be alive and well. Queued up to watch in full later. I wonder if he had signed a 60 day exclusivity deal with Ross Coulthart that just expired which is why you will start seeing him appearing everywhere now. I bet he did. Where are all these other whistleblowers, have they grown a pair yet? Or still too scared?

Anyone else getting a Wright-Patterson feel from the current comments?

So whose this random ass interviewer that somehow got the hottest UFO name for an interview?

This is Grusch’s first interview after a congressional hearing? Wow. These YouTube bros are the exact opposite I was hoping would his follow up. What’s up with the thumbnail for the video? Still seems sincere but this knocks it down a notch for me.

Okay, I’m into the dad bod now. Damn, didn’t expect Grusch to be my awakening to that.

The video has no sound for me so not sure what he is saying but I would assume that "baggage" has something to do with long held beliefs that we have about NHIs and we certainly do have some long held beliefs.

I think it goes beyond oil. What of we had tech to cure cancer amongst other things. Big pharma would be in a world of hurt..

I think he alludes to some NHI possessing human DNA.

I wonder if that different path could be as simple as adopting electric cars in the beginning of the age of the automobile instead of oil.

AKA humanity is engineered to help other species solve their hardest problems. Personally, I'm flattered.

Excellent interviewer

What I don’t understand about Grusch, at least ideologically, is his unwavering loyalty to the same power structures that are committing a crime against humanity, that is if what he claims is true and the military industrial complex is hoarding energy technology that could mitigate our climate crisis.I think if he forced the issue and called their bluff, a lot of good could be done, but his patriotic faith in proper channels prevents this.

What a great interview. Thanks for sharing.

Dave Grusch seem like such an awesome and respectable dude. He’s so down to earth in this interview.

What a great interview!!

*Watching a bunch of podcasters and redditors unveil the almost century long UFO secret* *shovels popcorn*

Talk, talk, and more talk…but still no evidence. Nothing has been disclosed until the people see the craft/bodies.

More progress here but let’s add that the MIC, who ultimately are the ones who are the gatekeepers of the technology and the craft and they are the ones who pay the politicians through campaign donations etc are the ones that need to be bought to justice. They have in their possession the technology that can give us free energy, anti gravity and a myriad of other amazing technologies that can further humanity as a whole but refuse to release it to the world because of I can only hazard a guess here but of financial gain, control and power? There is the flip side too, should these technologies fall into the wrong hands then this could be detrimental to humanity too. But at the least the free energy aspect should be released to the public. I know there is trillions of dollars tied up in energy investments and millions of jobs are in jeopardy if they did but we do need to dismantle the current infrastructure and we will need to recreate our manufacturing sectors to be able to implement this new technology into our manufacturing industry.

First I love that he granted the interview (and did an entire panel with their to top followers!) to these young alien researchers. He validated them and called out the old boys who did the deep cover up having “low energy thinking.”Grusch himself is a nerd and a great one 💯

aka the X-files was right

Yaasss thanks man

[deleted]

He says that crashes are not "mission failures", but "maybe some seeding". Earlier Elizondo suggested that crashing their objects to Earth can be interpreted as a kind of communication by the NHI. I think this would be completely logical on their part, considering how materialistic the human race is.

Exciting times with an extraordinary man at the helm.

This was a great interview. And it actually answered many questions I have. Really enjoyed a knowledgeable interviewer who illustrated many connections between names I've heard but now understand their relationship to each other and the phenomenon

Unrelated to OP caption but man, what a f*cking angel this guy is, so kind, so genuine, doing what us, the people, want

His first interview since the hearing is with a youtuber?

All we ever hear from all sources is "something's coming, idk if you're ready or not though, be ready, it's about to happen, your perception will change any day now" Ok thanks when please?

Can anyone explain who the interviewer is? He's got no more than 30 youtube videos, 4 instagram posts and his twitter has a handful of tweets a year. Im probably just ignorant but who is he? How did he get Grusch for this?

The ‘debunkers’ are out in full force today.

Hey negative comment people, aka bots or intelligence people working for Uncle Sam - we see you 😘

Sick of no one spilling the beans. Just fucking tell us the truth. Show us some goddamn evidence. Stop making up new words for new laws for new rules for new forms of psychological warfare on civilians through obfuscation and endless legislation that fuels endless wars against nameless threats to our data collecting sattelites. What the fuck is the truth? Why is this whole thing slowly happening? Is all of this just a distraction what is it distracting us from? Where are all the people with so called biologics? Where are all these other whistleblowers? What the fuck are they even whistling about beyond dancing around telling us anything? This whole thing since the Chinese balloons has been such an annoying series of Big Nothings. I’m over it at this point. It’s all a ruse. China, just take over the US already

This man does not skip leg day

I think this guy is bullshitting all of it.

Mr Grusch should write a book and publish it anonymously. Humanity has a right to the truth. Things cannot continue like this.

Baggage like assisted evolution and religion was an ideology created for us to provide morals and not kill our selves to extinction?

[removed]

If we find out that the government has been torturing intelligent life; I think we need to ensure that those involved are in jail for life.

Don't celebrate until it's all out there, they are still fighting to hide it

“Nothing vast enters the life of mortals without a curse.” - Sophocles

I’m interested in the people will question their religion part in all of this. I would love for something to be disclosed about that and what happens after death. That would be incredible.

He mentions the Ark of the Covenant. [Which was recently stolen by a prepared military](https://panafricanvisions.com/2014/11/ethiopia-ark-covenant-reported-stolen-church-authorities/)

What does he mean by “baggage”? Should be interesting

“It’s not my job”… it’s all of our jobs. And how do we know the ones “whose job it is” are not in on the cover up (which I’d argue they are)?

The only reason he’s allowed to talk is because he’s been instructed to talk. Why? I don’t know, but I don’t think the need for disclosure bodes well for humanity. Brace yourselves gentlemen. I’m a really good guesser and I’m guessing disclosure will be a real mindfucckk.

The "uncomfortable stuff" he's referring to is the "capabilities" aspect of these entities. These entities have not always been here. Some are extremely dangerous and have a capacity for extreme violence.

Bot comments are going overtime out here, so many accounts with ridiculously high karma through almost only comments 😭 It is literally this man's 3rd mainstream appearance and people have all manners of preconceived notions regarding his credibility and mental wellness when the man has been nothing but well-spoken and level-headed in all 3 of his public appearances so far. As if the disparaging critics here are more thorough, more analytical, and have more resources available to them than the CURRENT Inspector General of the Intelligence Community and the folk that work underneath him. The very same active IGIC who is conducting an investigation on David Grusch's behalf regarding foul play and reprisal from superiors, the same IGIC who has been holding classified hearings on the UAP matter for at least 2 years now, and has personally deemed, with the authority of his office, Grusch's claims as credible and urgent. Not to mention the NDAA was written with the help of the White House and has been breezing through Senate just about unanimously. Also the fact we even have an AARO office (and all of its preceding legacy programs) in the first place. You guys are really speaking against so many degrees and accounts of credibility, and for what? Worst case scenario? Aliens were a red herring in order to safely embezzle funds to other legitimate secret programs ILLEGALLY and without oversight, and we were lied to for that very purpose for decades. And really I'm happy with that too, because at least it would actually be investigated. But the belligerence and overt hate here is just bewildering, if you're going to get so messed up and emotional about something so minor like this interview, you should probably take a healthy step back and a short break from current developments

tl;dw: Two hours of wild scifi topics, zero evidence.

hes repeating the elizondo formula to the t. - make the most wild claims - when asked about evidence play the "oh my nda haha you know" card - then make more wild claims - collect love and respect from believers these trust me bro folks are really annoying. if you have evidence show it. theres zero chance that you can make all these claims without any problem and that this isnt covered by your NDA but if asked about even the tiniest evidence all of a sudden you arent allowed to say shit. but hey trust me bro haha

"doesn't want to overly disclose" so that the internet can take his vague language and run wild

To all the people claiming “religion will be obsolete” if NHI is disclosed as real… many of the major religions talk about other life forms and worlds. Islam, for example, in some detail talks about such existences and will only be vindicated by the disclosure of NHI. If anything, I would say the fact most religions rely on the concept of faith and free will could have a lot to do with the NHI controlling disclosure so carefully — not to interfere with our choices. In conclusion: we should keep an open mind.

I still think we are overestimating Grusch’s impact on forcing disclosure.

This is just as reliable as a tiktok video of some douche sitting in his basement. Show proof or stop with the “trust me bro people told me about things”

The nerve of Grusch refusing to go to prison from spilling classified information. How dare he.

Can someone out there just please give us the unredacted fucking truth instead of this drip drip bullshit, I'm so tired of it

Its US but from a different dimension, thus "non human" Imagine string theory, where in a parallel dimension, we have discovered the abilty to cross btw "strings" THAT'S whose visiting us. And they have been since we went Quantum in the 40s, as just like in space, were we search for signs of life... In a string theory universe, you'd look for strings that have a "likeness" to your own. Its no fun travelling to the Alt Earth where NOTHING survived the Jurassic Extinction.

If no one else is gonna put it out there, and you know what all it is and are willing to talk, then it absolutely is your job to tell us about it.

I bet some of what he refers to is on my site badaliens

Show evidence or shut the fuck up. "Not my job." You're a fucking human being living on this planet and if you are not a fucking dick, you would sacrifice some jail time to be the person who demonstrated evidence to the world that intelligent life has occurred elsewhere in the universe prior to our arrival. It is your job now. And this whole trope that society couldn't handle the knowledge when thoughts of beings from other star systems has been in the public consciousness for decades. So fucking dumb. This one clip gives off the I am either full of shit or delusional.

I've only been following this closely for the last few months, and I'm already long tired of the teasing stuff. Just tell us what you claim to know. If it's true, then no one is going to put you on trial for leaking classified info that changes the course of human history.

These comments are interesting. So many low thinkers

Oh, I don’t think he’s in danger of overly disclosing. Just around the corner. Just have to wait a little longer. Any time now.

This whole mindset of everyone involved is ridiculous. The “bare minimum” path to disclosure is NOT going to work. There’s no master plan for a slow calculated disclosure. He’s running the risk of everything he’s saying going absolutely nowhere. The powers at be will do absolutely everything in their power to keep this hidden. Hinting at vague possibilities will do fucking nothing. If you’re going to hold back, don’t say anything at all. He’s not helping.

If they manipulate space/time, could we potentially see our dead loved ones?

So just finished watching this. What strikes me as a bit disappointing, is how the whole video is presented as 'cool guys hanging out' chatting and joking about the most important subject in the world. It has a strong vibe of pure entertainment value, rather than a serious approach that a subject like this deserves. Grusch seems to have a good time talking about all this, and that's fine. But, unfortunately I have a feeling his credibility drops from this.

"I don't want to overly disclose." - So now he doesn't want to overly disclose? I can't believe how many people are falling for his bull. Goes to show how gullible people are. This guy has provided zero evidence other than, "Trust me, bro. I worked there. People have told me things."

in this interview he strikes me like hes full of shit

Doesn’t want to overly disclose because his stories are bullshit, if he doesn’t say to much than he can’t be overly wrong

This guy is all blow and no whistle.

Either release something tangible or not. This "not my job" thing is pointless. If you want people to be on board with this subject and break some barriers to mockery and dismissive opinion.....then put something concrete out there.

Grusch was great, but I'm disappointed the whole video is basically just an essay of all the crazy theories the youtuber believes

This guy is selling fucking snake oil and the true believers are gobbling it the fuck up with a spoon.

Why should we believe him? It just seems really strange to me that he says he doesn't want to disclose too much because it's not his job. And that he's only trying to disclose the bare minimum to propel disclosure? That seems like total BS, just disclose more. Wouldn't that propel it faster?

If grusch has evidence release it and go to prison. Every country on the planet would petition for his release.

I was really disappointed with that and for the first time find myself questioning his credibility. If everything is true as he believes it and he isn't on the grift I don't get why he wouldn't just take the time to tell us everything he's allowed to tell us right now in one go or dodge questions with ridiculous responses like 'it's not my job'. You came forward and nobody else has, if it's all true it's the biggest story in human history and people have a right to know as much as they can. He didn't have to go public so whether he likes it or not if he knows the story it is his job to tell people. It's not like he's just a military/national security guy and has no interest in this either, he goes to Star Trek conventions for gods sake so we know he has an interest in the topic. Obviously he can't reveal anything classified or anything that would hurt his sources but tell us everything you can or don't bother at all because people are sick to death of all this vagueness and people teasing us and wishy washy interviews like this really hurt his credibility and hurt the cause because a lot of people will watch that and dismiss him as being full of shit. For the record I still believe him but I can't work out why he's holding stuff back.

Every time I l listen to this guy, or to the other “whistleblowers,” they are always talking “around” the information. He’s not telling us anything about specimens of alien lifeforms. He’s talking about a conspiracy. Never do we hear any actual fact about visitors from outside of planet. We hear about some “stuff that’s about to come out.” We are given reasons for him not discussing it like “because that’s not my job,” or some discussion of “high level individuals” who are afraid to come forward. It always seems apparent to me that he is a fraud, spinning conspiratorial BS. Of course, part of buying into any conspiracy theory is that it’s kind of fun, or gives you a sense of being part if something that is not mundane. So that may motivate you to discount what I am saying. But I thought I would throw this out there to counter some of the “now he’s got them because he’s setting a trap for the Illuminati” type comments I see here

“I Don’t want to Overly Disclose because it’s NOT MY JOB”… REALLY?!! And disclosing everything else waaasssss your job??!!?.. I hate when people do this, Either you Tell EVERYTHING you supposedly know or Just sit down and shut up because it makes you look sus!!

[removed]

My goodness, this was remarkably well done.

Why oh why didn’t I take the blue pill Ignorance is bliss

I feel like he’s saying that this will destroy religion.

One of the many things that bothers me about all things alien coverups is imagining being the human beings not telling everyone that aliens exist. There has to be so many people deciding that withholding all the facts from the public is the best option. Whether it be greed or fear the public will implode with the info. I just can’t picture so many people being okay with the secret for so long. There has to be hundreds or a thousand people who’ve known or know the truth about life outside of earth. And yet here we are, talking on an app about it. The why is what bothers me

Information I thought about today while watching this that could be useful to someone. Lockheed Martin used a company called “Directorpoint” for files. Mainly for board meetings so the board member could use an iPad instead of a big stack of documents. That company was purchased by “Diligent Company”. Not sure if Lockheed is still a client of diligent company.

When are we going to see some aliens?

Wake me up when theyre found. This alien teasing has gotten boring

No doubt the folks here paying out on the Gruschster were all believers of the MH370 videos and Las Vegas Alien...

The next person who “overly discloses” will be the first.

Any technology that could get to us would be sufficiently advanced enough that we have no realistic chance of "catching" one.

Is there some secret “teacher” that instructs these guys how to say so much without saying anything? To stop and just stop short? It’s fascinating.

Why doesn't he sit down with a non ufo type, not necessarily a sceptic but somebody not already favourable to the topic? It's all softball questions he is getting. Sit down with an independent journalist or scientist or at least somebody who will challenge some of the things he is saying.

Just some random question for my own study, how many of you guys happen to also own GameStop, BlackBerry or AMC stocks?

...any day now. ...yes I know we've been saying that for the past 40 years but trust me bro.

At this point of time i can not langer stand this bullshit. Hard evidence or bust. Shake the world or crawl back into your hole. Spacetravel or spacetourists global or nothing.

This guy is a hero. I don’t have much, I live on food stamps currently between jobs, but keen to donate to anything benefitting Grusch. He is releasing information of historic proportions. We all need to donate.

Always always always riddles and vague mysteries statements… I think he’s only the level…but It’s stuff like that that makes me feel the entire thing is a grift

Why is everyone so hyped up by this guy? To me it seems like he's a kid that swears that he has heard other kids say that they saw a rated-R movie the day before... I mean, his statements are by their nature unverifiable?

This guy is just milking for attention

oh more nothing

All grifters all the way down

I’m convinced now more than ever that Grusch has been fed mis information and has taken it as fact, which mean he isn’t lying but believes everything told to him… why does everything have to be so cryptic, it’s why we are where we are

Can someone timestamp where he talks about his friendship with bigfoot?

I will never cease to be amazed at how gullible some people here are. Big revelations are coming any day now, some unspecified time in the future, trust me! From the "Mussolini totally had a UFO"-guy no less. Anyway, pm me for a great opportunity involving the inheritance of a Nigerian prince.

"It's not my job to disclose that." Yes... it is... that's the entire point of being a whistle blower. Instead, this guy just honeydicks everyone and then goes on a tour of interviews/TV/podcast.. Shady...

Can we please get this guy in front of an actual physicist?

Think about how the course of human history could be changed by this technology and information. Yet, Grusch only wants to nudge Disclosure along and it’s not his place to disclose it, blah blah blah. Yeah, okay, dude. Keep telling us something is coming. Keep moving the goalposts. Rinse and repeat.

Dude stole interstellars plot

How do people still believe such an obvious grift, to the point they act like religious zealots over it? Dude can't back up a single claim, and hides behind 'muh national security' whenever pressed even an iota. I want one of his supporters that make constant 'appeals to authority' to explain to me how he's somehow more trustworthy than past 'intelligence officers' that led people by the nose intentionally in the past, or how anything he has to say is remotely trustworthy when he wont share a single crumb of information to the public. Like, are we just supposed to blindly trust the same government that CONSTANTLY lies to us? How am I supposed to take this guy seriously, he's part of the same community that lied right to our faces to get us into Iraq with crap like 'yellow cake'. This guy has yet to do a single thing in 'good faith' involving the public. edit: Unsurprisingly, after mass downvotes, not a single person actually bothered to try and answer my proposition, because they can't, which is why they're mass downvoting in the first place.

What does Julien Barnes have to say about all this?

What is the baggage? Crimes about funding ...or the Elizondo comment about "soul searching" (eg NHI in olvement in human afterlife) or that religion is going to take a hit

I'm so sick about hearing about all this evidence that supposedly exists. Soon! Any time now! Just you wait! Now listen to my favorite sci fi short stories!

As an online piece I thought it was a good video, and showed Grusch in a more relaxed environment. From that perspective worthwhile. From the perspective of disclosure, it is a nothingburger - as he says in the video, he's not going to say anything further than he got DoD permission to say before the News Nation interview. Don't expect any further revelations from Grusch.

Overly disclose, please.

all these decades of scientific studies and we really went back to "it's true because joe said so"

Daniel Riccardo looks bored

Interesting, george knapp and jeremy corbell did say grush was "muzzled" by the IC for a while now but this coming week he'd be "unmuzzled" and here is a new interview! I guess they were right about that.

[removed]

who is this kid and how has he gotten the biggest names to go on his podcast? Valleé, Puthoff and now Grusch?

He’s not allowed to talk about any classified information. Doesn’t it stand to reason that anything “they don’t want you to know” would be classified? So if he’s alluding to it then it’s probably not true. I think intimately this guy knows a lot of people and has heard lots of stuff but unless it’s a first hand account I’m not buying it.

What baggage? Saying that baggage comes along with it implies that the government is guilty of something in relation to the existence of NHI? Either that or the baggage is simply that the government was wheeling and dealing with the NHI behind the backs of collective humanity.

It's true. All of it.

My shot-in-the-dark prediction? They will say they engineered us. But they are lying.

I wish there was discussion about how Lou Elizondo / Tom Delonge's perspective fits in here. They seem pretty convinced there is a patriotic reason for the secrecy and that a lot of the NHI's are not our friends. I have been following this stuff for over 25 years and for some reason I fear Delonge might have the right idea and I hesitate to contact my government representatives to petition for disclosure for this reason.

I’ve always loved David Grusch’s thighs.

Why is he doing interviews with these little channels??? I had never heard of news nation until his interview. Then he does an interview with a channel that has 100k?? What am I missing here?? This could be a part of why no one cares. If you're not into this stuff, you're not going to see any of this

Grusch sounds a lot like Q. Something’s always on the verge of happening.

Mouth breathers unite!

Everyone missed it! Baggage as in mh370? Lol

“I don’t want to overly disclose the existence of entities that hold our lives in the palms of the hands (if they have palms or hands) because it’s not my job”. What a crock.

Very interesting video. Beats all the crap on this sub this past month.

Is this sub finally ready to admit he’s got nothing?

What a nice long-winded way of saying nothing

I don’t know what it is exactly, but there is a qualitative aspect to his semantics andinflection that projects a certain naivety. I know that’s paradoxical, but it’s the impression I get from Grusch.

I’m losing interest 😔

Overly disclose?? Starting to reek of BS

An unknown(at least to me) youtuber gets to interview him for the first time after the hearing. This just proves IMO that the big media companies like CNN, NBC, NYT etc do not want to touch this guy, or give him any form of credibility. I'm certain Grusch would have accepted an interview with any of those given the opportunity.

iooooooohhhhhhshiiiiiiiiiii get in here bois and gals! 👽

Let me extend my 15 min of fame by sitting here, saying nothing or talking bs. Nothing! has bees "disclosed" - no new information has been given. Only the "Soon, soon, soon". Its a pile of bs.

We need to focus on this guy the most. Fuck Coulthart. This man actually has something.

The “baggage” comment is the new “somber.” People will endlessly try to explain what they believe he meant.

If he knows the most important information in the history of mankind and has proof, he needs to speak up. This is bigger than him and prison and whistleblower status. At this point, put up or shut up.

It's not his job? It's nobodies job. Everyone involved could just say "it's not my job" then it all just fizzles out into no evidence and all talk. Someone needs to go beyond their "job" and show us what the hell they're talking about. Because otherwise it kinda feels like we're just getting jerked around.

This dude’s only interesting characteristic is sounding like he is saying something. Every sentence is actually devoid of substance.

People that believe this guy fall for authoritative bias.And this guy knows it.

"He talks about time and how it might not be linear as we perceive it, when talking about the nature of reality he goes on to speculate that there might be higher dimensions "casting shadows" upon our reality, just like we cast 2d shadows on surfaces" \-Sure, but does any of that actually mean anything or does it just sound cool and confusing?

Still only Words. Show us Evidence. Only Words for Decades. Show us Something...

This is exactly what you’d say if you were making it all up for attention.

All the marvels of the universe are always a step away, according to these people, but nothing ever comes. I wonder how gullible people can be to still believe these false advocates of disclosure?

Thats right, edge it out some more. Has he started selling access to his foundation yet?

He is very goofy in a way, and I'm not discrediting him because of this, but I would expect that IF this really is a disinformation campaign within the intelligence community to sort out the weeds, he would definitely be one of the targets. Why would they want to do this though. That's a good question. I don't really know what to believe tbh.

Deep Government Secrets being leaked to the public happens from time to time: deep throat, pentagon papers, mass data surveillance. But for some reason, this is the secret that makes every leaker and/or journalist go, “would love to say something but… gotta respect the process, nda’s, national security, etc…”

I’ve never found this guy genuine. Just my personal perception. I’d love to, but can’t.

Lol is that so

Some non-human biologics with baggage just flew over my house! 2 more weeks yall

Non human biologics Sorry to burst some bubbles but By definition That Can be a cat, dog, snake etc

There's something about his face that makes me distrust him.. Not saying he's isn't telling the truth, though..

STOP. David Grusch please stop. I believe he believes he is telling the truth. I believe he was bamboozeled.

lol, backtracking and managing expectations for when zero details emerge. Just more BS. Next.

most non whistle from a whistle blower - i can only whistle if im skiffing dude

If you trust this man on UFO's, i got news for you.

There's no over disclosure. There's the truth, or just more lies. Give us the damn truth.

So tired of this cryptic crap. If you know, just spit it out already. So many people claim they know what is going on but none will say what it is.

BIG NEWS IS COMING! /s Same story over and over. More nothingness. I'm a skeptic.

Nut up or shut up

"I can't say it's aliens... but it's aliens. Trust me, bro".

This dude is so full of shit

I am trying very hard not to form an opionion based e tirely on his cadence,tone and facial expressions alone.

no problem I'll just do mental gymnastics until it doesn't seem like he's full of shit anymore

Just another grifter.

He doesn't want to "over disclose" and cites that it's "not his job to release the more important details," because he's full of shit. No seriously. This is like standard boilerplate speak that literally everyone in history with "big news on XYZ" has ever said. This guy is a quack with a microphone.

I Call bs. He is an intel guy 🤷🏼‍♂️

This guy is a joke but he has suckered everyone into believing in these big government conspiracies that taps right into the same ideology as Trump. Nothing is going to come from this guy, ever, apart from his own lucrative appearances, publishing deals and social media engagements

> I don’t want to overly disclose As in you’re making it up and the more information you give the easier it is to discredit you. Fucking grifter.

[deleted]

Do we have a timestamp for the biologicals remark?

As always; provide some evidence. It’s all hearsay and make believe until there’s actual evidence, ‘clearance concerns’ aren’t one of them. This guy is a compulsive liar until that happens.

We should ask him what he thinks about the MH370 videos

[removed]

So much speculation here I’m hoping he literally means suitcases

So, any tangible proof?

Sick of people's bullshit

Total BS. Is he a whistle blower or not? He's a psyop mouth piece.

watching this clip with audio off, he looks like he's playing piano. love the rythm there. super excited to watch the entire interview tonight!!

At this point i believe it's some sort of psi op. Every one of them are saying this shit "something big coming" "I know stuff but cant say" bunch of empty words.

Has gotten to where the more he talks, the less I listen.

Hey guys, I know some secret stuff about aliens. Can't go into too much detail until I get all the attention I didn't get as a child.

I don’t trust this guy he has that frat boy mentality, I’m not excusing his credibility but he’s always playing safe while garnering attention, or he’s an alien cause his face looks disproportionate. Just come out of the closet bro humans ain’t that bad.

I keep hearing non-human biologics can mean absolutely anything. Tree. Cats. Mushrooms. So why do we keep using it if it can describe any living thing that’s not us. That’s our entire world. Every time I see non-human biologics I just think someone’s pet dander was found.

I think I'm out of the loop. Can someone tell me who Jesse Michels is and why Grusch chose to talk to him? It seems like a major step back for him to be interviewing with some random youtuber.

How long until he pulls the 'I'll reveal the details in a documentary I'm making' card

He looks and sounds like he's loving the attention. I don't know...... It's a whole different vibe.

Another "Trust me bro... Big things are coming." The amazing thing is how much of this you guys go crazy over.

This interview confirms to me that he is a hoax.

I will (maybe) believe it when I see it. So far, lots of words and nothing of substance to back it up.

[removed]

What about the theory that none of what they're saying is real because if it were, then it would be highly classified and the government would do everything in their power to silence these people

I don’t know who this man is but he seems like one of Joe Rogan’s ass pimples come to life…

And the grift is revealed. All this stuff is BS, it always has been and always will be. Give me some fucking evidence besides a balloon or a light in the sky. It’s been 80+ fricking years.

It feels quite pointless to post these nuggets while they contain so little evidence or even information that would lead to evidence. If all he's got is "just trust me, I know a guy" it's just not going to cut it. He could be the actual misinformation agent with what he's using the whistleblower name for: a whole bunch of nothing. I'm sad he's the guy we are concentrating on over the two first hand pilots accounts.

This guy is taking us all for a ride, it’s been months of drip and nonsense with nothing truly credible, just enough to keep you on the edge of your seat so you come back. Just another grifter.

This dude is sus

More vague horseshit with no evidence to back it up from a man who's absolutely loving the attention you're giving him.

These motherfuckers don’t know shit. They just crave attention. Please stop giving it to them

These people are so insufferable. “There’s so much evidence out there and I know every detail of it. I’m not gonna say anything because I can’t/won’t/don’t want to. But trust me something big will be learned soon”. Like that’s what’s been said for like 60 years.

Yeah because if you actually were to say something specific, people would expect you to come up with evidence. Keep on grifting baby.

All these guys speaking out are just wasted breath. No actual evidence is shown other than their word of mouth and a few decade old videos of specks they can't explain and don't have any high resolution evidence of. The amount of times they get interviewed by some youtuber nobody conspiracy theorist or jerked around by some credible news station that just like the idea this is generating clicks is just over the top right now. Until some real evidence comes around I will just ignore all these nobodies.

really sounds like a fake medium or anyother conman honestly. So vague his information is useless

Big talks and zero proof still.

So, nothing, right? Wouldn't want to "overly disclose", which is akin to providing evidence. He's happy to disclose all of the wild claims and theories, though.

[deleted]

This man is built like a shit brickhouse

I have a feeling that this is hurting his credibility somehow.

It’s been an interesting couple of months and I had my hopes up that something interesting evolves in the end but now it’s been months and it’s the same as always. In the end there was a lot of talk but 0 proof and I think it will stay that way. Grush taking the Musk approach, make several promises to hype people up but then never go through with it. Interesting marketing approach and it’s fun to watch the journey but if there’s never a finish in sight it gets boring at a point and for grush the point is this interview, for me personally. I lost interest now.

Show don’t tell

where's the new reddit.com where bundles like r/UFO users get laughed out of the room. how is this on r/all. if this is fueled by trolling and people watching, why aren't you guys on the hard stuff like recommending drug use.

No its not. Nothing is coming. I still cant get on board with this. This is going precisely nowhere. Not a shred of evidence. Not a shred.

Yes, I definitely believe the man that has backed up zero of his claims.

oh good grief you people

I smell shit.

This guy seems like a bad car salseman now.

Dude—-fuck the baggage, just SAY IT already. Tell it like it is—we can handle it! What is everyone so freaking timid about it? Darwin dropped the bombshell on religion in the 1800s. So what—aliens “prove religion wrong”? AGAIN? We already know it’s all shit, so just tell us

I can see his most sensetive parts

Star Ocean 3 shitty plot twist gets more real every day..

Could the none human biológics be monkeys and dogs that were sent into orbit before

Covers mouth and coughs “bullshit!”

Go away until you have something to say.

Pics or stfu

This guy is full of it.

Is he saying that NHB could be like bird shit or squirrel saliva?

this guy has some real fairytales huh lol

Got to keep that grift going.

vague as usual

[deleted]

If you watch this on mute it looks like he's a mime dribbling two basketballs.

My cat is a "non-human biologic". A fucking tree is a "non-human biologic".

this guy really enjoys the limelight

He talks like a complete bullshit artist. How many specific claims does he make? Zero. How many things does he say that can be independently investigated, verified, proven, disproven? Zero. How many things does he say that can be either directly corroborated or denied by other witnesses and experts? Zero. This is how bullshit artists operate. Everyone from cult leaders to snake oil salesman to people who peddle in fake conspiracy theories always talk exactly this way. And it's never an accident. It's because they know that as soon as they start to say things that can be proven, disproven, or independently verified, the grift is over. But when someone genuinely believes in something, these are the types of things that they tend to say, right or wrong.

All it takes to find out all the details is buying his books! Lol how can anyone believe this bullshit

Yeah, definitely don't tell us too much. We need to drag this out as long as possible, dude needs attention.

overly disclose, not my job means &#x200B; I lie

Be better if he doesn't do any interviews. He did his service

Non human biologics... So like... Animals? Plants? So if a uap traveled thru the ocean and hit a few tuna on its way out before crashing...

lol if i tell everything what would i be selling next year

Lol, remember: This guy hasn’t seen anything first hand, his words too. Please get off this dudes’ penis. He hasn’t proved, shown, disclosed anything of substance yet. Don’t be surprised when it’s more waiting, backtracking, bojangling, whistleblowing, just outright UFO/UAP/NHI/whatever-the-fuck edging . I’m definitely not looking at a guy who’s telling the whole truth. Practically sings the word “job”.

If you can’t tell this is a lie then there’s just no hope for you

[removed]

People actually believe this shit? Happy to be proven wrong but jfc Reddit 😂

It's coming guysss! Next week for sure this time!!!!

Where evidence

So Grusch basically sounds like he wants the credit of disclosure but doesn't want to push it so far that it would cause severe consequences(death or jail). Or the second theory, bro got too high on his own aupply

It’d be really funny if this dudes just been fucking goofin on everybody

"It's not my job." Sorry, but my bullshit detector went haywire when he said that.

How about show some evidence and stop talking for once?

He doesn't wanna overly disclose, god forbid right?

This guy has zero credibility with me. He is literally saying he just wanted to put enough out there to stir the pot and is not sharing more because it's not his job. Listen....the day anyone has any real information about aliens they will be on CNN throwing their own mother under the bus if shes the one keeping secrets.. He doesn't say more because he is full of shite.

Lmao “I’d hate to give too much evidence” don’t worry you havent

Everything this guy has said could be said by literally any human on the plant. He gave not one specific detail. Idk he seems full of shit to me. NoN HuMaN BiOloGicS... so like a potato?

Oh, for fuck sales with this bull shit. 🙄

This guy is a fucking moron

This is all appears very controlled. He says he only wants to reveal enough to propel disclosure. Dude if you know more then just spill the beans. I honestly think he's been informed on exactly what he needs to say

Anyone claiming to know things I just can’t believe them. Sorry

People who are delivering important information don’t wear shorts.

Why so upvotes in this Topic?

„Does not want to overly disclose „ means he could if wanted. Is not a BD surprise David, just the biggest revelation in human history.

Sorry, I want to believe, but this guy knows nothing.

I said in this forum that Grusch was a plant by Pentagon Intel to discredit the UAP effort of disclosure. I’m now more convinced of that then I was over two months ago when I watched his interview with Russ Coulhart. HE’S A RINGER. A PLANT AND HE’S FUCKING UP DISCLOSURE ALONG WITH KNAPP, CORBELL AND COULHART (“The Enablers”). Those 3 aren’t doing it for the Pentagon. They’re doing it for money. But Grusch? 100% on a kneecapping mission.

It bewilders me how this community still believes this clown. I do think there's something out there, the US Government released footage of UAPs such as Tic-Tac, Gimble, Go-Fast, the orb over Mosul, Iraq videos are second-to-none. This beady eyed clown is just taking everybody for a ride. "Ya, I ain't seen 💩 for myself, but people told me & showed me a picture of spaceships that are the size of three football fields inside when the outside is the same size as a US fighter jet. Oh ya, and these 'aliens are malevolent and harm people.'"

Sounds a lot like [this](https://thejournalofcosmology.com/Puthoff.pdf)

This is my next golf outfit!

Hey what's that thing that's slowly rotating/morphing behind the interviewer on the left? lol 1:07:52 'ish In the full interview video

[deleted]

Baggage is the right fuckin term for it, with this topic.

Those chickens are up to something E:I see this sub doesn't like jokes.

Not enough people talking about that hose he’s got in those shorts for my taste…

"Some baggage is coming with it" "It" being disclosure? That is a curious way to put it.... what could he possibly mean by that?

Im just baffled that this lad and Yes Theory are involved in this with David Grusch. Seems weird but I’m not complaining. Exactly the exposure thats required.

Now what about the warehouse 🤨

I thought this was UFC and I was reading this like former ufc fighters were having a discussion about altering time l like time altering is gonna make fighting different.

Baggage aka diseases like a mofo

Nice fencing in the background.

Espouse not exspouse.

Has anyone ever truly thought about what a world with essentially limitless energy looks like? Not a utopia, I'm pretty sure. As far as I can tell, humans would quickly harness essentially limitless energy to synthesize all the world's *finite resources* into the newest and coolest phones or whatever until literally no trees, metals, or sand were left.

My dog is a non human biologic.

What’s with the hands tho

will someone please strip his audio and add in some dope keyboard instrumental

It’s just a bad break up.

What if its just animal testing? That would fit the definition.

Dude's a product of lead poisoning

I don’t believe him. Too eccentric. He’s acting

On that grift again

Bs Just say it if you care Why is he protecting the government If you really cares about humankind This is all b*******

“I don’t want to overly disclose because it’s not my job”… At this point you have whistleblower status. I’m calling BS on all this now. I was a believer of this for a while, but now that things have completely gone stagnant, I’m calling BS. He enjoys being in the spotlight. These guys would make more money if they fully disclosed what they know, name names, and write a book about their experience. If it was true and they disclosed top secret information they would be protected by the whistleblower status, and the court of public opinion.

Nothing remarkable will happen

Same old tired excuses. I’m tired of these guys just riding the wave.

Dude really ruined his credibility by backing up the MH17 abduction video. Just proved he’s doing this for the attention for me.

[removed]

Ooooooh yes, more wore words and zero evidence. But please, keep spinning your threads.

Hearsay until proven otherwise.

This narrative just keeps falling apart

So let me get this straight , he "knows stuff" but he "wont overly disclose", huh??

Non-human biologics. So the only evidence we have of “life” as we define it is here in earth. Why do we all keep jumping to conclusions that it’s extraterrestrial? Nothing of the sort was said.

Why can’t he just spill everything at once?

I’ve had enough with this guy. He’s so full of shit. He wants his cake and to eat it too. Just another talking head who says everything and nothing all at once. He has accomplished nothing.

Looks like prince William lite

[removed]

total grifter. dog turds are non-human biologics. weird how he changed his tune from "we found bodies of pilots" to "non-human biologics" when he's under oath. nothing firsthand, just a bunch of "dude trust me"

What’s up with t-shirts in interviews? It’s a bad look.

David Grusch is a psyop.

Im not believing a word from him

Not even listening to him and in 10 seconds I can tell he loves the production and the attention. No one with his background would use their hands that much when speaking or giving an interview. I'm sure he spoke a lot of words without saying very much.

How could anyone believe someone who moves their hands like that when talking lol? I also think it's a lazy excuse that the lack of evidence is for fear of legal action. Given how passionate / adamant he is and how this discovery (if true) would be the most important finding in humanity, I find it difficult to believe he would stay silent on legitimate evidence. If you consider yourself a skeptic, then maybe reconsider if this guy is telling you the truth.

this sub is always a big ol nothing sandwich and everybody here is pretending like anything these dudes say will actually matter even though everytime something popular comes up on this subreddit its so incredibly vague that everybody starts making up their own story. this sub is full of hopeful idiots

Just another scammer from the looks of it.

Actually no it’s not. This was a nice summer distraction but it’s over Linus. The Great Pumpkin ain’t coming so time to leave the pumpkin patch. They kept saying full disclosure in “a few days…next week…next month…soon…”

Is he playing an invisible piano while he talks?

[removed]

Oil & gas got us here, but we have to be smart & recognize that we need a different direction. No big deal, we have live drones on Mars, we can figure this out. But yes, oil is the way currently & unfortunately. Because it’s all that we war over. It’s not a good look. I’m over it. Gotta do better.

The real proof is always just on the cusp of being released. 🤔 HMMMMM......

It's been over a month since those hearings, now nothing. He can't disclose anything to us we all understand that. Congress said they were gonna get to the bottom of it or cancel funding for all these contractors. How come there are no updates? Sav

He con artists the shit out of you tinfoil hat people and you guys eat it up. Such a shame what happend to this sub

I'm just gonna lick the tip but never put it in my mouth

"I don't want to overly disclose, because it not my job" - guy that gave up his career to disclose information

There are no aliens or biological remains. This is just another play to scare you and confuse you into submission and compliance. I would say they are doing a good job of it when I look at how the American people follow government instruction so well without question.

Full of crap lol

Does he have any snake oil to sell me? He sounds like this guy I work with who predicts the end of the world twice a month.

It’s wild how there’s always shit that’s about to be revealed, but never gets revealed. It’s almost as if aliens don’t exist…

Overly disclose aka don’t wanna give up the game by saying anything people can verify as bullshit.

This dude seems full of shit. The whole “I know stuff, but don’t want to tell you.” Screams he is looking for attention, but doesn’t really have anything to say. He uses words to sound knowledgeable, but not really elaborate on anything.

I think this is most likely all fake, why did they don't just release everything they have on NHI/UAPs if they are so willing to start a serious conversation about this phenomena?

Can’t believe an asshole that spreads stupid shit.

Stop moving your hands like that when you’re storytelling

I can't wait to know more about this! In the meantime, I'll just be sporting [my non-human biologics shirt](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1518446572/nonhuman-biologic-alien-softstyle-tshirt) while I wait I guess.

At some point the talking needs to be backed up with some evidence. I don't think that point will ever come.

I pick up non-human biologics every morning with a pooper scooper in my back yard. I've got 24 kinds of non-human biologics just in my spice rack.

is this another overpromising loser? yes. because there are way more of them than there are aliens

As an analyst that actually did the job he claims to have done, which I don't think he's lying about that, I have to say this guy is a grifter lol. You guys need to be smarter than this.

These fuckers are just teasing information to make money at this point. Disclosure is going to be halted by capitalism.

Feels like he just stringing everyone along?

[deleted]

[deleted]

This guy is so full of it. The more he speaks the clearer his bs is so evident.

Lol yeah sure

non-human biologics could just be dog poo

please just speed up the big reveal cause this is nothing but sad, empty words

"Trust me bro"

Grusch fell for the known hoax 1930s Italian UFO crash. Why does everyone believe everything he says with literally no evidence? Edit: downvotes with no replies. Classic r UFOs

I wan to believe but.... The probability of this being remotely true is slim to none. The physics, the mathematics that any of these dudes postulates are concepts that we, in our current time understand and have theorized about. NONE of their supposed science is beyond the concepts we accept might be true in our time. WOULDNT such advanced beings be working on different mathematical planes, concepts - so unimaginable and un-perceivable that Grush or Lasar, elizando or any of them would be telling us that? Never have they shared any tangible concepts other than "these beings are advanced" well, no shit sherlock.

He is more full of shit than the famous shit seller of old London town. If you take this dude seriously you have to take a good long look at yourself in the mirror!

That Grsuch... so much ado about nothing.

he kinda looks alien... hmm

Two little kids arguing: “Of course I know what it means…I just don’t feel like saying right now. “

Is there ANY evidence produced by this guy?

So tired of all these guys' predictable pattern: "I know all kinds of amazing, mind-blowing things...but I can't tell you any specifics right now."

Crackhead outside Walmart be like :

This guy is obviously full of shit. He says nothing because he has nothing.

This guys a liar.

More bullshit from a bullshit artist

I'll just take the word of a balding thiccc guy at face value then?

[removed]

he needs to describe what these things look like or STFU at this point

All this blue balling has me so uninterested in this whole aliens thing now. Wake me up when a real video or contact happens *yawn*

Somebody talks with their hands too much.

It's just plant or animal biologics... I can't get over this, they clearly state it's non human, but never clarify. The uaps have mres on board and no1 questions it..

Let's be real this is total BS

Whats with the new hand gestures? ✋🖐️👋🫲🫱

I am starting to doubt him a lot. What does “over disclose” even mean? If he has important info he needs to share it. There seems to be a paradox where he says there is stuff he knows but is not allowed to disclose because of classified it is, but if he did disclose it what is the government going to do? Prosecute him for leaking classified info thereby admitting what he claims is actually true?

He seems insane ya know

[removed]

All this attention because he said some people who know told him so.

Anyone in the aerospace stocks better get out asap

Why is there nothing talked about? Is Mike Lindell the one releasing the report?

Uncomfortable biological stuff? Not the probes?

Anybody who talks with their hands like that...um NO!

I love the tan line. It’s….

he needs to come out with his 🌈🌈flag

This doesn’t help. I was waiting for them to shoot baskets off a football stadium.

God I love this sub. It's always "soon" and "can't disclose" and it's eaten up by everyone as truth. Great for laughs while taking a shit.

Snowden is brave. These guys are tools.

Isn't the whole point of a "whistleblower" that they take on great personal risk to expose things that government doesn't want to be exposed? How is this guy a whistleblower? He makes insinuations and outright claims that he knows the truth and has evidence (or knows where evidence can be found), yet when pushed to show the goods he just says that he's basically not allowed to disclose anything? And he isn't even willing to consider providing the truth in spite of this? I think this guy is a real believer but it's being used as a patsy of sorts in some kind of interagency/defense contractor internal struggle...

Useful idiot in a limited hangout.

Hopefully believers will start realizing that this guy is full of crap.

This stuff is all distractions I mean look at that guy, he screams “federal agent” everything about him Balding, the golf outfit, his thighs look worked on consistently…doesn’t skip leg day like a normal person, one of those black wedding bands

I'm pro Grusch and pro disclosure, but I've got to say this interview was trash. The interviewer spent 2 hours asking him to speculate on things that David doesn't have to answer to, nor claims to. I'm sure what he does know is fascinating, and of course there are good reasons why he can't talk about it, but this random speculating pointless. I can read Reddit for that!

You mean “does not want to actually say anything, prefers being vague on purpose”

“Trust me, bro.” -This guy

[removed]

Non-human biologics? So you mean animals. So plans crashed into some animal homes. wow. that's amazing.

If he isn’t a liar, he’s a fucking coward. “It isn’t my job” Whatever, grifter

The biologics meaning our human looking creators, or the biologic robots they created as their go-between known as the greys? I'm thinking it's the human looking one's who created us that he is referring to.

I think it's just experimental craft. Stuff that's fast cus its basically remote control and isn't limited by hearts ability to pump blood against g forces for example. Even Bob lazar chooses to believe the alien shit he saw was probably fake to test him if he would say shit or to be able to flag experiences to specific researchers, incase a whistleblower blows. IE every scientist working on the propulsion device is "accidentally" briefly exposed to a different color fake alien in passing when working on unbelievable technology, so if someone blows they can associate a scientist to a specific piece of specific fake information and identify the blowee. A red herring per sey. So if someone blows and distorts his voice and face and says he saw a blue alien at the facility working on xyz, they know only Bob was exposed to the fake blue alien when other people got setup to accidentally view other colors. I strongly believe that biologics are just a popular technique to identify whistleblowers and as a result the whistleblower community has whistleblowers who believe there's aliens because multiple people share similar experiences seeing things they weren't supposed to that was faked for intelligence, reinforcing their belief while also seeding a lie to protect the truth.

Whatever. This is bs.

“Pay attention to me! Pay me! Sorry, can’t give details, because…….reasons.” Sounds like every religion, Trump’s “policies” (still waiting on that ‘big beautiful’ health plan), and any other number of con artists.

The hand gestures on the under armour dude went from Elton John playing piano, to Whoopi asking her audience to stand up and agree with her. Teton's expressions after a few too many edibles might make me a believer.

Ah. I get it now-- He's been the non-human intelligence from the start (I don't mean that in an insulting way)! But, his mannerisms and Lazars are the give away... That's why they can't be in the same room at the same time.

[removed]

Honestly the more this guy talks the less I believe him. He doesn't want to 'Overly disclose' because he needs to milk this for as long as possible.

This guy is misleading you all.

They found animals in the wreckage, the baggage is the issue of animal cruelty I’m guessing. Or it’s nothing, and he’s gotten a platform because the gov knows there’s nothing there.

I found the use of his hands like that to be very distracting. Looks like he was trying to play a piano softly.

Sooooooo nothing

You guys eat this shit up, and for what?

I worked for the NGA and the NRO too, everything this guy says is lol, but the UFO industry is a bussiness and their customers really want to believe so who am I to judge? He's got a good grift.

I’m started to get convinced he’s pushing some kind of agenda for the government. He talks like a spokesperson. Wry interesting this is all coming out when we are about to go to war with Russia, when they have armed nuclear missiles…

Hey could tell much more then he did

[removed]

[removed]

my god, this guy is just stringing you along to make his fortune. still has provided zero evidence.

[removed]

David Grusch is done. He's not going to say anything new ever again is his life. It's just doing cringy entertainment like this from now on, and books and other grifts.

lol. this guy is so full of it.

Someone needs to do the piano thing on this vid.

I got hypnotized watching his hands

[removed]

Maybe he means they came with literal baggage like luggage, with their initials on their underwear and everything. I'd love to see NHI luggage.

Pics or it didn't happen. Literally.

He’s got known mental health issues….

He might be a hybrid.

This guy looks like a cop, talks like a cop, acts like a totally-not-undercover-cop. I call bs in all his stories.

so if you throw a box of worms somewhere and say it fell from the sky its a UFO crash with non human biologics that does not mean anything

How long will the people here get strung along before they realize theyre getting duped

He’s dangling a worm to catch a fish.

[removed]

Can I say all this UFO stuff is just a distraction from the horrible climate crisis we’re experiencing that will disrupt billions of people in the next 20y. Come on-what’s a better distraction than leaking info we all know already.

Lol they are A.I.

He is a fed plant. To distract us from the atrocities of our government.

I don't know who this David Grusch is, but he looks like he could sell some shit to cure tinnitus.

Good lord, just watching that thumbnail wore me out. How animated can you be? God I hate when my gut tells me something my heart doesn't want to believe (that this is all scripted)

is there way i can block this stupidity and naivety convention out of my feed?

Let me just fill you up with smoke. LMAO.

Smoke and mirrors

Verifiable physical evidence or GTFO.

I think David Grusch is trying to sow the idea that we need to reimagine ourselves in a new light, because the future is only going to get harder (something we might know, sure, but not something everyone *feels* equally) and folks are going to need stronger philosophical constitutions than what’s been reinforced by their respective cultures to survive. Not all culturally held beliefs levy themselves to the rapid changes this world is producing. So, there's that...and, oh yes, the financial baggage. Yeah, there’s a lot of that. Of course there is.

This is bullshit

These ppl just are using there old jobs to gain fame.They all talk alot about nothing.What can he say in a book he can't say in an interview?He wants ppl to buy his book.Itl say absolutely nothing real or itl be a Sci fi novel.Giving this dude and similar popular ufo talkers the lime light gains nothing but money in the bank for them.I was curious when fravor told his story, since the it's all talk, book, and podcasts with zero info. " we know, but we cant tell you" Nonsense Iv lost all interest

Source "Trust me bro"

"...And its Louis..."

Bruhhh they're only doing this to distract from everything else. If they did find alien DNA it's very likely to be bacteria or a single celled organism not found on earth* For at least 1 billion years

I didn't like his rationale for knowing he wasnt fed misinformation: "my friends wouldnt lie to me, knowing it would torpedo the friendship"

They want their people and ships back huh

Wen biologists

My guess is amphibians. The Abyss irl.

Anybody got a link to this full interview? oh, sorry, he linked it already: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRO5jOa06Qw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRO5jOa06Qw)

since the start of his channel jesse & his crew knock it out of the park EVERYTIME man

Apply it where is the full video?

The “baggage” Grusch is probably referring to is the kidnappings and their use of DNA to create hybrids better capable of living comfortably within the atmosphere. It’s caused some serious distrust and unhappiness and they might not be willing to stop until after they’ve finished.

Where can I see the fill interview of this please?

[But what does it Mean?](https://youtube.com/shorts/fK3k9b2vcEY?si=X2bcrqw9YfOXJWyq)

You want to know the uncomfortable stuff? It’s the abductions, the implants, and the alien human hybrid program these beings have been carrying out. We live in a zoo and they have been visiting this planet for thousands of years. They look down on us as ants.

Breadcrumb thread please

Sanity check for everyone: I totally believe in likelihood of alternate tech trees based on alternate physics models, whose basic thoughts about what sorts of machines to build and how best to do the engineering work to build them is so totally foreign from our own that years after first contact large portions of our two worlds are still going to be convinced that most of tech either of our species considers totally understood and mundane the other would insist is rube goldberg bullshit that the laws of physics would never ever permit to exist.... But however mibdblowingly foreign our tech and theirs are to eachother, they still have to be built out of the same elemental ingredients. This means: no undiscovered light metals, and probably also no element 115

Yooo thanks bro I don’t think I’d have seen this, gonna go watch the full thing now haha

What does this mean?

The baggage: every human household needs to adopt an alien because they need a place to live. They behave like spoiled teenagers until they are 100. Prepare to get stressed people

So when's the next big step? hearing? release of more info? any particular date to look forward to?

It’s what the Vulcans say isn’t it? Do we smell that bad? 🖖🏼

Grusch did another interview?! When did this happen?

I haven't had a chance to watch yet, but does he mention anything about others coming forward publicly? The 40 first hand witnesses?

"Congress shall now vote on approval of HR 8791...." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWfKdKWJEkM&ab_channel=TheOnion

Can they just take over already. I’m a working slave as it is. It won’t be any different when the aliens take over.

IMHO the big secret is that government fucked up somehow. Since we don't see them daily it's likely that proper contacts and crashes would be extremely rare ( like one in millenia ) and US blundered it, by e.g. dissecting the entities and now they wont contact us even when we transmitt to them or something like that. And the big problem besides public backlash is that there would be serious international consequences as most likely others have archeological crafts, small samples, radar or video data etc but no live occupants.

Stupid bot, your message is too short. So I will add more so this comment will post. What baggage?

So what's the baggage? What's your best guess?

Where's the freaking 8 hour Coldheart interview??? Where *is* the 8-hour Coulthart interview, though?

I haven’t had a chance to watch this one yet. Does he say anything new, or is it all just more vague information?

I am so tired of his B.S tell him to bring actual proof or stfu all talk can't even show us a pic..

Curious how this guy got the interview over Rogan haha

Grusch zesty af

I stand by what I said. Grusch is the new Bob Lazar. I want all this to be disclosure. But he’s now on podcasts and making money off of this. He’s protected by his “whistle blower” status, but won’t disclose any hard evidence. He says that he won’t to protect his clearance… but if what he’s saying is true, wouldn’t that be in his rights to disclose it all?

How is anyone taking this dude's bullshit seriously?

How do people talk to this person face to face and not immediately get the subliminal impression that they're being misled? The entire presentation of how he speaks, looks, and gestures gives off warning signals that he's not representing the truth faithfully. To me, it's as clear as day, but it's curious that other people go along with this shit.

Sociopath vibes.

This guy has liar pysiognomy. His attire, his voice, his mannerisms and non verbals. If you guys can't tell this guys a silly little duck telling you a story you want to hear.....

What a plant

Notice he never says anything specific or falsifiable! Then again why would he? He’s speaking to a very specific audience ready and willing to believe. He’s got to keep the grift machine moving forward because there’s people eager to believe who will happily feed its ravenous maw so long as their bias is confirmed.

[removed]

"Not my job....but enough to put the flag out there" I don't trust this guy even after they role out the sports model, the bodies of aliens and a live one shaking hands with people on live TV. If I had second hand knowledge like he did. I would be very concise and very serious about it, like the pilots at the hearing. He is a game show host.

The fuck is this guy even trying to say?

Lmao how do people watch this and put more stock in it's veracity than in a Marvel movie

It's coming people.... it's coming.... it keeps on coming... but soon, soon we will know..

Y’all really eat this fake shit up huh?

The exposure that Grusch gives to the public is much appreicated, but I hope the media does not consume him into a "crazed" celebrity.

I continue thinking that the baggage to his info is that the uap have biological occupants. I wouldn’t assume it is very probable for biological organisms to travel inter-dimensional and maybe not faster than light. Advancement technologically is likely to lead evolution beyond limitations of biology. I do think the NHI are interacting with us in ways that humans would find compatible. Which means maybe the biological beings are manufactured not that different from the craft.

Why would he say everything he’s saying but not be able to admit another morsel of info? I can’t think of a logical reason for him to do that, other than to keep people interested

Sir, you’re only allowed 2 bottles of Element 115.

Also interesting how when he submits for DOPSR, he puts the agencies running the SAPs in a catch 22 situation. If they don't give him clearance, then he can just mention the name of the agencies that didn't approve a specific part of his DOPSR and also push back on that. So it's better for them to just not say a thing and give him clearance.

Oil and gas holds us back, I bet

Maybe unpopular but I disliked this interviewer a lot. He has the propensity to lead the question and interrupts mid-sentence *all the time* (usually to name drop some scientist/theory that he knows). This in turn leads to Grusch speculating on things he has already previously said he can't discuss in public so he's essentially telling us nothing new, this whole thing is a 2 hours of speculation on the interviewer's part and just chit-chatting and not necessarily what Grusch knows about the phenomenon as fact but rather his opinions on what it could be for the most part. He agrees with pretty much everything the interviewer proposes as a possible theory. Even the thing about the NHI taking a different technological path is just Grusch personally speculating on what he thinks (he prefaces this by saying "if I was a betting man"). But for anyone interested in this part of the interview, this is the plot of Harry Turtledove's 1985 story *The Road not Taken*. The only new thing to come out (at least new to me) is the tie in between UFOs, the Manhattan Project, Atomic Energy Act, and the Department of Energy (kudos to the redditor who wrote a bunch of posts on this connection already). Feel like the actual time Grusch spoke was probably 20 minutes, if not less, and these youtubers, while knowledgeable on the topic surely, seemed really amateurish from a journalistic pov.

I have to keep correcting this, but the holographic principle isn't what he's talking about. Holographic principle is about a flat 2D space projecting the universe as we see it from it's boundary, essentially infinitely far away. What Grush talks about, where higher dimensions project into lower dimensions, is **not** the holographic principle. &#x200B; edit: for anyone who reads this later, the commenter I replied to removed mention (and wiki link) to the holographic principle, so my comment has no frame of reference anymore.

This idea has always been interesting to me. Humans always assume that technology is always invented sequentially and exponentially. It sort of is in the way that it gets better and better and builds off itself, but the original scientific breakthroughs are what start the chain. An Alien species may have made breakthroughs in propulsion systems completely different than our reaction systems for travel. Something completely unfathomable to us because we have been focusing most of our science on streamlining reaction systems to be better and better instead of looking into other methods that we deem "impossible". Maybe the aliens are relatively the same age as us, just their path in tech focused more on gravity systems, telepathy, etc. Maybe they don't even use computers or AI like we have become advanced on, but they can travel vast distances/between dimensions. Just some thoughts I have

IMPORTANT DISTINCTION : He mentions SOME of these NHI may be on a similar development level as us

I wouldn’t touch Lazar topic with a 10 foot pole if I valued my credibility. Think about it. The court of public opinion has really weighed in on Lazar and there are some folks who would immediately smear Grusch if he started to align himself with Lazar. Especially since he was not there at the time. I don’t blame him.

Several of the things he mentions have been mathematically proven to be possible in the field of theoretical physics and quantum physics. The casting shadows on our dimension especially, goes in to an area of physics that tries to explain all of existence like an infinite onion or bath. Which could explain why we see electrons and photons behave as waves as well as particles. Super interesting stuff, though my understanding is very limited.

Haven't a few people already more or less said Lazar is full of it? I thought Puthoff or Davis, Elizondo too.

Wouldn't the assumption be due to compartmentalization that he would not know about Lazar? Or the other 1000's who worked on programs since the 80's. I would assume he barely knows who's working on what currently. Despite his hostile, non hostile list.

>Alcubierre Drive I don't know how to pronounce that. I move that we just call it "The A-Drive". All in favor?

Absolutely fascinating read

There's a theory known as shadow biome theory I think some popular sci Fi movie or book discusses the concept.

Is that all he says on the topic?

Man if and when all this proves to be true, the entire fabric of our understanding about everything will completely change. I’m not surprised that it has been kept hidden from us.

Kinda reminds me of the story the road not taken https://turtledove.fandom.com/wiki/The_Road_Not_Taken

>It was disappointing he didn't put and end to the Lazar story Mellon, who has connections to Grusch, went on the JRE and stated that he did not find Lazar's story credible.

If Lazar's experience were real then Grusch clearly would have run into people who knew him or at least run into the program that matched Lazar's descriptions. The existence of Element 115 as a propulsion mechanism alone would confirm Lazar's info. So it seems to me that Grusch is just covering for him because he doesn't want to upset the UFO community or get on anyone's "bad list".

> He also says he has no info about Bob Lazar, he wasnt on the scope of what he was looking into and if Lazar really has had some experiences he(David) has no clue This literally makes **ZERO** sense.

People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but actually from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint - it's more like a big ball of wibbly wobbly... time-y wimey... stuff.

Non-linear time? Is this Arrival (2016) lol

Thank you for keeping me awake tonight. Read your comment 2 hours ago, it's now 4:30 am, im awake and excited.Had no idea another Grusch interview was released.If yall haven't watched the link, I'd suggest you find time. Totally mind blowing.Thank you for that experience.

So much speculation for someone who hasn't even seen an UFO or an alien.

testimony straight from a decorated military officer with the highest level of intelligence and the debunkers will still claim its a balloon or starlink

YES, we aren’t that facked. Bob Lazar did mention once that if Tesla had gotten his way. With power being transmitted over the air. Computers and micro ships would be an impossibility. I’ve never seen anyone mention NHIs having anything related to computers all their intelligence artificial or natural seems to be biologically related. Would be pretty ironic if this is not the way things went for them. As that means we’re in the cusp of turning things 180 degrees on tech development, if we reach technological singularity. With the advent of true AGI being formed.

Lazar is so full of shit, I don't get how he became so popular. He was raided by the FBI for creating illegal fireworks, he built a rocket car following a guide anyone with the drive and tools to do it could have also. He simply likes attention. When he went on Rogan he conveniently had intermittent headaches to dodge hard questions and he also had that quack guy with the beard to not so subtly divert and control the conversation.

Theoretical physicists have been saying interesting things about time for awhile now. Time not being linear and there being multiple dimensions (I think Hawking claimed that there were at least 11) is not a new concept

That seems like pure speculation on his part. There’s plenty of evidence these craft and beings have been around for our entire recorded history. They likely are responsible for our creation. I’d say they’re a wee bit more advanced at that point.

If they're really not that much more advanced, they should just get rid of us now before our tech catches up lol. We are dangerous creatures

Wow I've been saying Alcubierre Drive for years but every time I do skeptics and even other UFO researchers come at my throat. I guess I don't believe it's actually Alcubierre's warp drive we're catching on radar, the physics relating to "negative energy" is off.Basically, the "how it works" is right, the "how it's done" is wrong. Truth is we're streamlining the mathematics with ai and supercomputers and recently lowered the energy requirement to warp spacetime from more mass than exists in the universe to the mass energy equivalent of a small star.. (Imagine what'll happen when a scientist that works in black budget programs "discovers" the proper mathematics to make warp drives work.)What they're missing with the alcubierre drive is a hack using superconductors, and high energy electromagnets, and what happens when you start rotating and pulsing them at high frequencies. This is obviously my biased speculation, but I have a decent accuracy rate with my predictions as confirmed by my partner and some friends over the years, but I acknowledge confirmation bias 🤷‍♂️ Honestly, I think the plan is to release this tech to humanity (partially because the world is ending) but it's gonna be a slow burn until the government-ai can automate every vehicle so no one drops dirty bombs from their Jetsons car. This will be a "developing technology" with notable moments in the next year or two, roughly 5-7 years from now, significant news coverage in 10, and working models in 15-20 being shilled as a newly developed technology. If all goes well I should be riding a spherical, ai powered, antigravitic taxi to work in the unflooded parts of the city in the final years before my retirement! Well..to touch again on the risk of this technology..from what I've learned these vehicles can't be weaponized in the traditional sense because you have a forcefield of high energy plasma between the craft and.. well..normal physics. Sure you might be able to shoot while you are still and just relying on mass negation, but you're a sitting duck. In "motion", bullets evaporate, rockets vaporize (possibly explosively), and don't even think about nukes.You need to utilize the same technology you're using to manipulate gravity.. So you focus your electromagnetic emmiters and generate plasmas that you can aim towards your target in real time. Evasive maneuvers? Who cares. Just flick the point where the 'beams meet' over there.Still, they (the ones keeping everything under wraps) need a way to ensure humanity won't blow themselves up with this tech. So.. Just wait until you have ai systems capable of running all your technology.They needed to wait until material science caught up of course, and I think we're getting there too. https://youtu.be/eS_rEzKdzBA?si=rnGkt9IFtqWb-39F https://youtu.be/8VWLjhJBCp0?si=axnntGwuw3aj68J1

So "different path in the tech tree" is the explanation for how they could have mastered faster than light space travel, but then get crash more than human commercial aircraft? Like they figured out the Alcubierre Drive, but couldn't figure out a flight computer that prevents them from crashing into the ground?

>He mentions that these NHI might not be that much advanced but they took a different path in the tech tree, and he speculates they manipulate space-time with something akin to the Alcubierre Drive # >He talks about time and how it might not be linear as we perceive it, when talking about the nature of reality he goes on to speculate that there might be higher dimensions "casting shadows" upon our reality, just like we cast 2d shadows on surfaces Why is he talking about any of this? At least 99% of his information is second hand information. All of the information that I'm aware of him sharing doesn't mention any of this. This feels very out of left field and something he shouldn't be speculating about.

I don't like all the rampant speculation. It seems unprofessional, either like he's trying to get views, or he's a genuine UFO fanboy and likes talking about this stuff. If what he's claiming is actually real, it's incredibly dangerous to wildly speculate about this stuff, as it can confuse the public. If it's real, just stick to the facts. However, the fact that he speculates so much suggests he knows less than people are giving him credit for.

This is like 99% overlap with the Remembrance of Earth's Past trilogy, I don't know how to feel about that. I'm not saying Grusch is knowingly cribbing those books and reporting it as his personal (first hand or second hand) knowledge, but it's odd how similar the stories are given Liu Cixin's is fictional and he didn't have any apparent special access.

this is what I'm here for, that this whole thing isn't actually outside of our comprehension, just needs some revision to how we think about certain things. I'm slightly relieved.

Interesting. If exotic matter simply refers to dark matter, normal and dark result in nothingness, it is feasible one could simply input energy and split nothingness into matter and antimatter respectively, then shift half in front and half behind. Boom. Asymmetric forces. The energy input would be in keeping the dark and normal matter separated.

Maybe that’s why we can shoot them down with missiles sometimes lol

Lol, I was the one who mentioned to Grusch that the images looked like the artist's rendition of an Alcubierre drive. Good to see it stuck with him.

Or they are plants and animals in mres...

> not that much technologically advanced > alcubierre drive The only scenario I would accept these both being true is if their home planet housed natural resources of exotic (negative mass) matter. If you can even glance at exotic matter it's because 1) exotic matter exists2) you are in a civilization advanced enough to put it on display without also annihilating the local area. No one stumbles into an alcubierre drive at an equivalent level of advancement as us. We have a long way to go.

If they do actually live under the ocean like that 4chan post speculated, then that’s completely different conditions for things like pressure and specific heat that would explain differences in technology.

Yeah, this is gobbledygook.

This makes me reconsider the Mandela Effect.

I’m watching the whole thing now. I find it interesting that they make the point that people will get 95% of the truth with 5% untruth. I think the easiest way to see if people are telling the truth is map it all out. If 90 to 95% of what Bob Lazar matches 90 to 95 of what David Groush says, then it would stand to reason that those things are real. Once you start mapping out the consistent statements versus the outliers, you can find out what’s real.

Read this it's insane [casimir engine experiment ](https://mim-armand.medium.com/proposition-for-a-casimir-engine-a6f61cfd8039)

Compartmentalization of secrets would indeed mean one person may have no idea what another is doing.

So Plato’s allegory of the cave was correct?

Given the degree of compartmentalization that exists, I would have been surprised if he knew anything about Bob Lazar. There is DoD, the Intelligence Community and DOE and they all have their own rabbit holes. Now throw-in the defense contractors and it becomes a virtual jig saw puzzle. No one guy knows where all the bodies are buried.

The highest esoteric and metaphysical spiritual teachings tell us reality is mental, consciousness is fundamental. We are unlimited.

>It was disappointing he didn't put and end to the Lazar story (either way) IMO, the controversy regarding Bob Lazar is a microcosm of everything that is wrong with the "UFO Community". Everyone just wants to have their personal beliefs validated so they can say "SEE, TOLDYA SO I AM SO VERY SMART."

I think that makes the most sense, and explains why we can still shoot them down. Advanced you may be, but a 10 foot rod of metal and explosives traveling Mach 3 and pulling 60 Gs is still a dangerous weapon.

Maybe this is why they’re interested in our nuclear energy too? Maybe aliens don’t have that tech?

Thanks for sharing! I will check it out.

Wow nice read, thanks, read it during lunch.

Definitely worth the read.

To think that, given the size length of time for what we now think to be the rare event that a species gains sentience and then goes on to develop technologically, that for TWO species to somehow exist at nearly the same points in their physical and technological evolution. That these two species somehow possess similar anatomy, compatible environmental adaptations, while also existing at the same time and nearly the same place. I’m not a statistician but I can say confidently that the odds of this occurring are longer than we could calculate. The math doesn’t make sense, I t’s nearly impossible for those things to all be true. The truth is that we MUST have more in common with them than I think has been shared so far by any well-known witness or whistleblower. It’s obvious this is what Grusch was referencing when he talked about “baggage”.

Cool story, thanks for sharing!

I'm thinking the baggage he's referring to has to do with how the government's handled the biologic evidence he refers to. Where they stashed it, who has taken ownership, what they've learned about it, that kind of thing.

Interesting that he twice mentions "little G gods", I heard DeLonge use the same terminology - is that significant?

I think the baggage is going to be that we share DNA with the NHI.

I think you are really quick to speculate. He’s saying there is baggage that comes with saying that non human biologics are also recovered as part of the ufo recovery program. He is literally just saying that after mentioning non-human biologics, hes not surprised to be met with the increased skepticism / lack of support from congress after his testimony because that is just the “baggage” that comes with it.

He doesn’t want to be the guy. Can you imagine having to break this news to the world? At best half of everyone would hate you, think you’re lying, doing it for self profit, etc. Look at how the public reacted to the pandemic.

I think it's more to do with that as soon as you show/disclose non-human biologics how we would react. There would be a thousand questions. Who are they? Where do they come from? What do they want? Are they benevolent? Are we in danger? He would not be able to answer all of these questions and would be better answered by those that have the full picture. Because it seems he does not know everything about the phenomena.

Wtf does that even mean?

That’s been his motivation from the start, so that makes sense to me.

I think this is kinda bullshit. He should say what needs to be said because otherwise we’ll only get some government answer to what’s really going on

There is always something that makes people give the bare minimum if anything at all. Like what the fuck is he waiting for? Do it already. At this point he's just another shill with his nonanswers.

Interestingly you can’t find this interview by searching Grusch interview on YouTube

"Baggage"? That's an odd word choice. Besides the literal meaning, it usually refers to emotions, beliefs, etc that affect how you think (like "emotional baggage").

I honestly don't know how I feel about that stance of its not his job to release the more important details. If he felt so, importantly, the public has a right to know that he opened this can of worms what does it really matter if he also releases the important details. Seems like what everyone else is doing on some level. "We know but it's someone else's job to actually disclose it - move goalposts out ten years" this stance just baffles me that we keep getting this run around. Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful Grusch came forward but he already went through all the hard parts, hes already talked about NHI bioligics, craft, even the vatican....why not release the details when he is so close to this.(it's one thing to not release details because it's classified and he legally can't- but that's not what he's saying here. He's saying even if he could or can he wouldn't because he doesn't feel like it's hid job. There's a huge difference between those two).

100% guarantee the "baggage" is that the aliens weren't dead, which means we had essentially illegally detained Aliens without due process or anything. Literally a inter-dimensional or inter-species Geneva convention violation or something. Additionally, it could be happening NOW.

Global warming I wonder

So, more lies. Eat it up, I guess. That's all this sub ever seems to do lol

It's not his job is such a cop out. It is your job for humanity in your privileged position.

He wants to say the bare minimum so he can stay in the spotlight for as long as possible. Dude's full of shit. Can't believe people take him seriously.

I think the baggage is that we've attacked them, and so now there is some kind of warfare occurring.

like that they killed jfk to protect it

Agreed.

The ending was wholesome. Needed some comforting. So much is happening right now and the morons in Washington don’t seem to be very productive.

I think it all depends on your perspective

Your comment comforts me

That’s how literally everyone is who has direct knowledge. The one thing I can say I’m good at is reading body language and you are right on the money. We have nothing to be afraid of

That's prob just the autism shining through

[deleted]

I wonder if we'll ever be nostalgic for a pre-disclosure world.

I got the sense he was hinting that we kept live aliens captured, without due process or allowing them to leave. THAT would be baggage with biologics.

But presumably the alien biologicals are in this dimension?

If I had a dollar for every time I heard this lately lmao.

I really don't know about that. I feel like everyone is so desensitized after covid, people would just be like "damn that's crazy" and move on lol.

Who the fuck wants regularly scheduled programming anyway? 9-5 can suck my Deeeeick!

>Once that cat is out of the bag it is going to be hard to get back to our regularly scheduled programming &#x200B; But it won't, though. It will interrupt our lives but it won't stop them. If disclosure happens with something that large, it won't affect our lives immediately because we all still have to work to pay our bills and survive. It will be the water cooler talk we all have at work.

Disagree--we already know from what he's said that we are being visited. New baggage would mean something else.

> We are going to have to accept that we are 100% being visited by creatures from another realm. Why would we accept that with zero evidence?

And all the things that opens up, to me at least, if aliens are proven to be interdimensional i would immediately Absolutely change my outlook to things like Jinn, or Bigfoot (also actually a spirit/dimensional being in native American history) would now be real until I'm told otherwise. Once something like that is proven possible we have to reexamine all of our folklore and legends to see what was more truth than fiction.

You mean there won't be 2 for 1 alien margheritas at Applebee's? This is some bullshit.

Our regularly scheduled programming is fucked though, and there needs to be a drastic change. I’ve been thinking a lot lately that the reason there hasn’t been disclosure yet is because the government wants to continue the status quo. And after disclosure happens the status quo will be at risk of falling apart

I’m a strong believer that they are coming from underground or deep ocean

> Once that cat is out of the bag it is going to be hard to get back to our regularly scheduled programming I doubt anyone will care much let alone alter our regularly scheduled programming. Just think of any scenario.

It's almost as if all of human history would have to be rewritten...

DMT already did this for me 🤷🏻‍♂️

So crazy that we are living in the most important part of human history. Maybe even earths history. People in a thousand year from now will wonder what we were thinking at a time like this and we are those people.

Fun thought experiment but they definitely seem organized with their visits and seem like they’ve been visiting a long time. I think their entire race is in on whatever they’re doing with us.

The Ariel school incident suggests that there are rogue groups of NHI that want disclosure/ for us to clean up our act.

It might be a better comparison to say they would be talking about us the way we talk about the Sentinelese or other less technologically advanced tribes. Their version of "disclosure" about us could essentially be to watch a quick little documentary and say "neat". Instead of Alien Grusch, they have Alien Attenborough. lol

They probably have a huge page on us in their wikipedia. Along with 30 other races.

That's fun to think about. "The government has been visiting primitive apes from a lower dimension for centuries!"

I mean, we're probably not the only planet they're visiting. I'm sure there's countless other earths that think theyre the only ones, and are seeing ships shaped like a candy from their realm. 😂

Just dropped last night! I was getting into bed as I saw it pop on my YouTube feed. When I saw it was almost 2 hours, i had to push it off until this morning 😕 https://youtu.be/kRO5jOa06Qw?si=YHO7c_Qfua3uARhb

I feel like that was the interviewer's goal with the whole thing. Casual clothes, hiking together, chatting in the car, knocking back a couple of cold ones on the porch... Maybe not done maliciously, but it still seems intentionally arranged to make it feel like the subject matter is no big deal. It would have been so easy for Grusch to spill more than the authorized number of beans at any moment.

What's the significance of this?

Isn't it a bit convenient that there's been a movie about Oppenheimer and suddenly he's a big UFO figure? I don't remember people talking about him pre movie

I think there's a hint in the diverging tech trees comment. In order to have a divergence, there's got to be a common starting or meeting point, right? They may have common ancestry to us and their evolutionary path diverged from ours a few million years ago in their plane of reality and we share a disturbing amount of DNA in common. Maybe they're what the denisovans would have become if they survived to become the dominant species.

The baggage is probably just how religious people might react. Any NHI would be viewed by religious people through the lens of their mythology. So they'd be demons/angels or whatever to them.

who is cornell

Mention in the other thread is that they’ve known each other for a few years now or whatnot, running in those same circles once he started down this path apparently. As to the rest, no idea

Watch his other interview with Hal Putoff and Eric Weinstein too, it's very good.

Jesse Michels. He used to work for Google I think. Branched out and started a podcast discussing a mix of topics…AI, UFO’s, ancient civilizations, etc

You could actually look at his page to see he's been covering UFO stuff since Lue

This has been my theory since a lot of the recent information came out. Parallel universes where evolution took a different turn. Science and peace were prioritized over religion and war. We could be an outlier.

You wanna hear some shit, let's talk Alfred North Whitehead, the man could math his ass off, and contributed significantly to the field of mathematics, so he's not some random dumb ass that was bad at other stuff so he moved onto philosophy. His story more so goes that, he got so good at math and science that he realized we're looking at everything from the wrong perspective, and our inability to consider things beyond ourselves as Alive and Reasoning. In fact he argues that Evolution although correct in some regards has reduced us to empty platitudes such as "Survival of the Fittest" despite everything which is alive being very unfit. As he puts it, "The Art of Persistence is to be Dead." His point being that only Rocks and Stars and inert things have any level of success at survival for any extended period of time, and even then they too are subject to change. And so when we look at it from this perspective we can very much see how Science has fucked us in the long run by ignoring evidence to the contrary as outliers. Let us now discuss the Virus, as it exists in modernity it lies suspended in a state not unlike Schrodinger's infamous cat, neither alive, nor dead. Which is stupid, viruses are very much alive, however science says that because it cannot survive in our environment, and so it must not be like us on any level. Wrong and dumb they are the microbiologist, you wouldn't take a fish out of water and then go, "This thing is not alive," why then would we examine a Viral Capsid outside of the human body and go, "This thing is not alive." Surely if you take a man and drop him in the ocean with no equipment his fitness goes down immediately and eventually he dies, should we then suppose that humans aren't alive because they cannot survive in water for extended periods? Or is there a fundamental mistake in how we are measuring or considering the fitness of creatures? If we're being honest, what it means that Virsuses are alive would require us to redefine the fundamental aspects of what is required for life at the most basic level, RNA becomes much more significant in the grand scheme of things because viruses don't necessarily all have DNA, and so on and so forth. I'm not a microbiologist, but I know it would probably fuck some shit up a little bit. Anyway. Science cool, but its also willing to cut a lot of corners for simplicity sake

It’s funny that the guy who testified to Congress and the world that the US government literally has UFOs and alien bodies is thinking “this guy might be too far out for me” haha.

>Thing I found of most interest was the deep dive in to the beginning of the uap topic and the scientific community that started all of this secrecy. There is a clear indication that a lot of scientific theory could have been manipulated by people wanting to slow down our overall progress in science. Haven’t had time to watch it yet. About what time in the video do they discuss this?

Good to see him happy and vibing, cuz he is in the know, and as much as I love sci-fi I have to keep taking breaks from this topic since it starts to get overwhelming and unsettling at times as much as it is exciting

i know a lot of humans… and they’re all stupid, ignorant, and shallow as a puddle. I really dk if they *could* handle it. Doesn’t mean anything tho bc it’s immoral and illegal to withhold this info from the human race. Disclosure is happening whether the apes like it or not. I think “they’re” just trying to soften the fall

That just makes it make even more sense why he has risked getting behind disclosure and being a public face for it. (chris mellon i mean)

Yeah, for weeks the hostile comments have all been putting down anyone who talks about anything *besides* Grusch and the hearings—everything else is a distraction, they’d say. Well, now that we have some news from Grusch, suddenly he’s full of shit too. Very sus.

Dude I know and it's really weird... They aren't just being skeptical theyre out right saying he's full of shit. Like what? He talks about some stuff as speculation and people say he's full on woo lol...

Intelligence community in full effect on Reddit

He never introduces any proof, ever. Not one scrap. It's all second- and third-hand hearsay. He cant/wont even name one person who had direct contact. He cant/wont even name the program or office that handled the supposed alien stuff. This is an immense waste of time. And we do not need distractions like this further eroding confidence in scientific institutions. It was a tremendous disservice for Congress to take testimony from the aircraft pilots who actually witnessed (or thought they witnessed) things they could not identify, alongside this consummate fraud (who was making claims he couldnt substantiate in any way).

Well people sure are saying a lot of things to make fun of in here lol.

You know what would be trustworthy? A shred of evidence. "Oh but he cant or he will go to jail!" Cool. This is why everyone thinks he is a clown. Whistleblowers anonymously leak devastating evidence. Clowns stand on the mountain top screaming that you need to just simply believe them.

He has the same vibe as every other salesman. If he seems balanced and trustworthy to you that just means you're his target demographic.

Just because you think he is trustworthy, doesn’t mean he is. You may disagree or think they’re being inarticulate, but simply dismissing every non-echo chamber opinion as seeds of distrust or noise is irresponsible.

They haven’t done a very good job.

I concur. Been saying this as well about Grusch and the other whistleblowers. Some don't seem to understand that, unfortunately.

And damn sure they anyone won’t pay him a visit in prison or pay his bills while he’s gone. Insufferable people on this sub I swear

So he's telling you what the intelligence community wants while not providing any evidence?

Imagine the court case where the CIA has to get a conviction for “disclosing that aliens exist”. Highly unlikely anyone gets arrested for this.

hes repeating the elizondo formula to the t. •⁠make the most wild claims•⁠when asked about evidence play the "oh my nda haha you know" card•⁠then make more wild claims•⁠collect love and respect from believers these trust me bro folks are really annoying. if you have evidence show it. theres zero chance that you can make all these claims without any problem and that this isnt covered by your NDA but if asked about even the tiniest evidence all of a sudden you arent allowed to say shit. but hey trust me bro haha

Yeah we are way past the line where the trust me bro answers should be taken seriously. I mean if its true and he goes to jail after disclosing it, people will pressure governments to oblivion to release him. Some nuts would probably try to break him out, even. Trust me bro getting thin. Spill the beans or fuck off already.

Anytime Corbell and Knapp come up it reply with this…. https://youtu.be/VmJLSuLmgdg?si=eHeWPDIMvUaCmnYv

If he tells everything, and it’s all true, he gets arrested, and becomes a hero to the world. If he tells everything and doesn’t get arrested, it wasn’t true.

This. Once you have kids and a family, even the biggest topic of all time becomes irrelevant if their safety is at risk cause of what you might choose to say.

That's not what the horses mouth is saying here, though. I completely understand if he can't share classified information for legal reasons - if that's the case, just say it. But he doesn't. He says it's not his job to share the important details, which makes me believe there is more he could say but isn't by free will. Or even if he could share - he wouldn't. The two are not the same.

I think it's important to keep in mind how the US has historically treated whistleblowers. I know Grusch has some protections but even still, better play it safe than get locked up forever.

If he is keeping evidence to himself out of fear of being arrested, he is a coward. If he actually presented the earth-shattering evidence that he is implying exists, our entire world will change overnight. His arrest pending a trial is a very small price to pay.

but the DoD greenlit him before the Congress interview, unless he has evidence which he doesn’t he shut his cakehole

The thing about those guys is, and I'm one of the first people to say that people shouldn't just trust anyone, there are proven facts relevant to those guys that thr public should be made aware of, but, and this is really exciting, the documents that we obtained prove beyond a doubt, and this is the relevant part, the documents show that Knapp and Corbell, specifically Mr. Corbell, who is a noted filmmaker I might add, who had gone on the record numerous times to bring all of this to light, and the thing is that he needs public support to get the authorizing agencies to approve the documents so they can be reviewed by noted experts in those fields. If the public wants to know more, they need to know thst there is something imperative and grave about the response to documents that they haven't released for public consumption but Mr. Corbell is aware of them and has likely viewed them. And there are numerous reports about the things these guys want to say.... I would like to pause and ask if all of this is perfectly clear to viewers who may or may not be reading a comment, this comment now, that is probably one of the biggest comments about Knapp and Corbell, if not the biggest comment, and I've worked hard to bring this to light.

Many have talked about this baggage. I think its something like they are just using us to generate something and we can’t escape their control.

It’s bizarre. And he’s a good looking man, too.

*Sweats nervously*

They will be here for as long as Reddit is a popular platform for discourse

USA can’t even get people to be janitors in hospitals you think they have people paid to read conspiracy subreddits?

Idk what people are saying about his looks but his body language and looks don't sit right with me. Guy seems like a grifter bro. He's also saying the kind of thing you say when you don't have anything but you've gotten enough attention/"success" that you have to give 'em something. Always open to things coming out though, would love to see evidence. Snowden got all that info out of high security but over the years not one piece of evidence has gotten out about something infinitely crazier, and now this guy knows stuff but saying it's not his responsibility to disclose, even though that's what he's setting out to do? idk, guess I'll just sit back now and wait for my treasury department check

Sometimes a fraud is just a fraud.

Yeah, i took it to mean that people will have a lot of opinions and feelings about what they did and how they handled it

It's gross.

Just another reminder that Eglin Airforce Base was recognized as the most Reddit addicted 'city.' https://reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/s/CHn6fHfpfR

Always has been 👩‍🚀🔫

I mean it was obvious before - but the sheer amount of outright crass & toxic comments in this thread alone is particularly insane, even for /r/ufos. *Literally* every-other comment in this thread is containing overwhelmingly crass, toxic insults of sorts and I'm surprised the mods are kind of just letting all of this slip by? Even the standard Jeremy Corbell/weaponized threads aren't this overwhelming when it comes to petty insults and negativity, and in such a short amount of time too. Especially when Grusch had a generally positive disposition with most regular users on here beforehand.

Good thing is I am just now looking into the comments and everything has been positive so we are doing a good job on upcoming the right comments. But maybe I haven't scrolled down far enough haha.

Also legally if he resubmits to dopsr they could just say no to things he already got approval for. Which might be why they don't want to do it again. The thing that has been bothering me, legally, anyway. Is: What are the regulations on the use of SCIFs to brief people? I don't imagine they always had scifs. So if you were going to read someone on to a sap you would just find a place that is reasonably secure and brief them. Right?! So do we know if using a scif is actually legally necessary or if it's merely ideal? But what if it's optional? Idk but I want to know.

This also frequently happens when you mention James Fox, Coulhart, Corbell or any other well known person who talks about this topic. Many comments sling personal attacks at the person, are aggressive to the point that it’s as if the subject of UAP is an attack on them personally. Remember you can report these types of comments, many subreddits about this topic allow comments to be reported when they are uncivil, political and/or are low effort.

Yeah why are you here (sub or even comment thread) if you find this to be shit or a waste of time? It's wild I can't imagine a valid reason to go on a thread or voice my opinion on things that I find dumb. Don't you have something you enjoy you could be engaging in?

I concur. Appreciate you speaking up.

He’s a regular looking dude with a dad bod. Like literally everyone looks like him. It’s crazy

I'm sure I will get downvoted for thise, but this short clip of him does not pass the vibe check for me personally. Something seems off about him to the point I don't trust what he is saying. That is just my opinion.

I’m here ‘cause for some reason Reddit algo showed me this post. Sorry, I don’t have anything nice to say about this no-evidence nonsense. Show me some real proof beyond hearsay, then we can have a discussion and ask critical questions. We all should know by now that human testimony is perhaps the worst form of evidence.

Well said

There are no vibe checks for disclosure, if the public feels like they are being lied to or being given the run around by Corbell and Lazar, they are more than in their right to be upset at them. You are not the gate keeper of peoples feelings no matter how rainbow and flowers you want the conversations to go.

Who fucking cares. It’s Reddit. Say whatever you want. You did and I thought it was annoying. Didn’t pass my vibe check.

Honestly, he should be more ashamed for grifting and exploiting such vulnerable people.

Yes, shut your mouths opposing opinions, because nothing bad has ever come from echo chambers!

Never go full baggage

What if the baggage he's referring to is related to whatever contact and/or contract we have had or may have had with NHI up to now. The baggage could be because we the people have had no say in any said relations or agreements that may have been made with NHI (if any). They could despise us because of the way "we" may have treated NHI in the past, due to our arrogance or ignorance. Or perhaps we agreed to let them experiment on humans as trade for less aggressive behaviors. I'm just spit balling here, but it seems there would be a lot of baggage that comes with something you have no way of communicating or negotiating with because the communications or negotiations have already been done for you.

I don’t want to receive a baggage of alien bodies. Send it to the scientists please

i hope thats what he meant, i did not read it that way at all.

I think he means the part of how humans will start to understand and view themselves... When it comes out that we're all robots of course.

Indeed, otherwise, I don’t want to receive a baggage of alien bodies. Send it to the scientists please

There's always been significant baggage that comes with mentioning non-humans involved with UAP. Ross Coulthart talks a bit about it in "In Plain Sight". You saw a UFO? Wow, that's crazy. You saw the pilots? Oh, _you're_ crazy. Mentioning something like that means significantly more dismissal than technology alone.

...that we are the 13th colony of Kobol.

Holy hell, you ain't kidding. 'Til now, I hadn't had a clear picture in my mind of the size and scope of the 'Anti-Disclosure Forces' operating around here, so this really paints a picture. It's like kicking a goddamn hornets' nest.

Yeah it's crazy

Really puts things into perspective doesn't it? Outrageous that it's permitted

The amount of accounts that came to this thread to write one-sentence trash comments about Grusch is astonishing. First time I'm seeing such a vast ammount of negative comments in such a short period of time after this post was created. Or maybe I'm just wrong, and this is the general opinion about him? I just find it hard to believe that this is the case in a subreddit for UFO enthusiast...

Yeah there is some brigading/astroturfing/smurfing going on. If you sort by new it is eviden5. I'm on HST and it's 1am, meaning most of USA is still asleep rn. But these bots don't sleep.

The US government is not the only player on here.

Good! We aren’t THAT stupid.

Why do you think they hide behind 30 day old accounts and a keyboard. They're cowards.

It must be something either bad, disappointing or freaky. Because if it was heaven or reincarnation I don’t think it would be shocking or hard to handle—certainly surreal. How would we even know if aliens were telling the truth about an afterlife though

Please post when you get the link. This interviewer was annoying as hell.

For real

He isn't unmuzzled in this interview. He still can't talk about the same things as before.

The mention of G.H.W. Bush also had me thinking of MJ-12. Perhaps one of the last of that group, assuming it was a real thing...

Oppemheimer wasn't part of MJ-12. MJ-12 was led by a member of the Bush family if I recall.

That makes sense from a higher dimension NHI perspective, but he specifically mentions biologics, and beings directly piloting the craft. If they're from a higher dimension casting a shadow into our 3D world with basic geometric shapes, how would they have biological beings piloting the crafts?

Just playing a bit of Devil’s advocate. I like your theory, but if that’s the case why haven’t they just landed in Time’s Square and straight up said “Hey guys your government is fucking you.”

Great thought on the 60 day embargo, that’s gotta be it.

Apparently they knew each other already I think

The first thing I thought was that they’re targeting young people to get them on board w this issue, which would really help the cause. Maybe I’m just getting old but this current YouTube aesthetic looks super tacky to me.

Something off about this whole shit. Its striking this weird tone of funny and serious at the same time, like an attempt by some very amature writers writers and actors to put on a drama. I smell bullshit, but I cant tell where its actually coming from. I think its more than money making though.

Yeah that’s a weird one.

Well when the mainstream media portrays you as a loony toons nut job what would you expect?

Its a half decent youtube channel, interviews with a lot of great figures but i tend to agree, the way its presented is to cater to either the algo or to younger people, up to you to decide if thats good or bad, the content is good imo. Good interviews with Valle, Nolan etc on there. Also worked with that red panda koala dude who has one of the best channels on the histories of ufo/uap stuff

I was wondering if I’m the only one attracted to him 🫣

Just to add. Free energy would have such a massive positive impact on the entire planet from allowing 100% recycling because recycling uses a lot of energy. The reduction in pollution. Lift people from poverty into a better life where they may have a chance to become productive citizens and contribute to the economy in a positive way that may induce a need to invest in better homes, appliances etc. Those are 2 positives I can think of should we go to the free energy technology.

And a UFO truther YouTuber who you just know won't ask any remotely awkward or probing questions.

Hide bullshit if you don't want flies.

Look at the two replies. They're barely even trying. Sad showing.

He doesn't have any. I've been around this subreddit since 2017 and seen this play out before. This is an Elizando 2.0. His job is to string you along with little crumbs of nothing and misdirection. Simultaneously, he is planting the seed of a threat element while pretending he has no clue what is happening. Every time he is asked to put up, he shuts up by hiding behind his clearances and NDA's. It can't be both. It's either a threat we need to know about, or he's bullshiting you about a threat to conceal what is happening in secret. Another fake hero paraded in front of you to sell a lie.

I've listened to guys like these for decades. All talk and no substance. Until this guy actually does literally anything that could be classified as actual disclosure I'll file him in the same file as the guy who was in the space Marines with Barak Obama in an underground Martian facility.

Seriously. What's always bothered me about Grusch is that he has done the opposite of [what a whistleblower is supposed to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y79i4Vx825w). Instead of anonymously leaking devastating secrets, he loudly and publicly makes claims about secrets that could exist. We just gotta believe him. Anybody with the knowledge he claims to have would be protecting his identity and liberating the source material, instead of going on the talk show circuit and doing a ludicrous song and dance routine.

> Show us some goddamn evidence. You must be new here.

Slow trickle down your leg disclosure is apparently the fashion these days. I think the problem is that after this plays out, where do you go from here. Gotta milk it for all it's got!

Beat post on this thread 🙌🏼

I don’t think you truly understand the gravity of what he’s saying. If life as we know it is just a small piece of actually what reality is, that is going to disrupt so much of the world as a whole it could get chaotic and mad.

I think he’s a bullshitter, his interview with Coulthart and this small clip feel overly rehearsed.

Indeed, the man is quite jacked.

Even to the US Inspector General? I know we haven’t heard from him but I like to think he has a state of the art bullshit detector, and as far as we know he believes David Grusch.

At first, I was interested as I always have been. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof, and none has been produced. I think it's just conspiratorial BS like all the garbage the far-right has swallowed around vaccine disinformation and election fraud, etc

I think he believes what he's saying, but you have to remember he personally hasn't seen anything. People didn't listen to his testimony. His claim was that in the course of doing his job he was told these things. When he tried to investigate it he was refused access and not read in.

love and respect and money*

Aliens could land on the lawn of the White House tomorrow and people will still believe in their religion.

Dude comes across as having a few cards being short of a deck

I mean he basically spilled the most important beans (that the govt has that stuff). Seems like if they really did have those things and it really was a life and death secret, the Gman would be heading toward prison right now. The Gitmo kind. But, he's out doing interviews about this stuff.

Just did some research into the recent Peru events (man face being ripped clean off no blood either) and they sound similar to cases in Brazil and The Dyatlov Pass Incident. High in radiation. 👀

Hey awesome site you have. Tanks for that! Also - we are kida fucked I presume.

Look what Snowden went through and nobody cared about what he had to say in the end. Why sacrifice yourself for a bunch of idiots (us)?

David, “transverse city” on Reddit said all that classified material that you haven’t been cleared to speak on won’t be any issue. You are clear to speak, Mr grusch! 🫡

high thinkers = i naively believe everything that fits my belief system? gotcha, einstein

By high thinkers I'm guessing that you mean people who have transcended the usual laws of logic, reasoning, and scientific method to reach a mental nirvana of being able to believe in claims without sources?

Believing intelligence agents without evidence = high thinkers?

I agree. I don't get what's the point here. He's just speculating and hanging out.

We don't want to hear about your sexual encounters.

Are the current and original ICIGs both ‘true believers’? Or is it possible that high-ranking members of the IC know a little more about the topic than you do?

He has already stated the government has killed people for less than he's already done. We're (USG) are also really good at killing people remotely. He may not want to die by revealing things too sensitive - For Example: David comes out and says NHI are actually spiritual beings that we have been in contact for generations, since the start of humanity. He says there are a few factions with their own goals, and humans have virtually no say in what happens. He explains further that Earth is just a testing ground for them, and your life is overall meaningless. Have fun with that information. US and other governments would start breaking down if people truly started believing David.

Astroturfer alert: user is active in many astroturfed subs. Most likely a paid shill. Pay no attention

Nono bruh hang on. Just hear me out! Very soon, there will be claims of claims that actual aliens live inside the government! And it's coming. The news is coming! Almost here. Evidence, oh there will be so much Evidence.

A top DoD Intelligence Official & former high ranking Air Force Officer quit those positions to grift for UFOs?

Me too. It’s the daily cognitive dissonance I experience. It’s gained congressional and global attention, but also it’s the way conspiracies usually work- vague promises of some important information we really want. It never ends. Then I think, but “Chuck Schumer”. Lol. For some reasons he’s my sanity barometer. Like to top on Inception.

When information is classified, if he isn't vague, he will go to prison. Its not very complicated.

His statements have been verified by both the current and original ICIG. The ICIG’s report should be out soon. I’d wait to make borderline insulting claims about a whistleblower until after the report comes out.

The slightly autistic man, with PTSD, who had a decorated and respected career in Intelligence, and has an open investigation due to his superiors threatening him, as well as his coworkers, wants attention? Please tell me more about your enlightened thought process, it seems you know more than the current IGIC

I also wonder if Grusch is doing this as a form of revenge on the people he knew was feeding him BS. For example, Grusch was tasked with investigating NHI operations in the government, and some people he interviewed got so annoyed at this intelligence officer’s constant probing for ridiculous info about aliens (lol) that they mockingly told him “Yeah bro, I saw alien craft and alien biologics too. Trust me bro.” Maybe Grusch took offense to being ridiculed. Maybe this whole thing is Grusch getting the last laugh by using whistleblower rules to disclose these people’s names to Congress in a SCIF, saying “Person X and person Y told me they work with alien craft. Congressperson, why don’t you subpoena them to testify before you under oath what they told me?”

Or a neutral journalist who is going to ask hard questions instead of spitballing various ufo theories.

Lol, relax, none of these folks can disclose anything that's still classified. The best they can do is lay the groundwork for future disclosures. He's *already* a hero for telling us as much as he did.

I thought he was pretty clear during the hearing that the information is still classified. Am i missing something? Does not everyone know this?

They all speak in riddles lmao.

Because he's a government sock puppet, and the word 'whistleblower' has lost any and all meaning. Welcome to blue book 2: electric boogaloo. The people thinking \[x\] bill in congress is going to suddenly get the government to snitch on themselves are delusional, it's all straight up grift.

[https://youtu.be/kRO5jOa06Qw?si=IE1MvHsN7dOvAm8\_&t=1040](https://youtu.be/kRO5jOa06Qw?si=IE1MvHsN7dOvAm8_&t=1040) If you watch this for like 1-2 minutes, he explains very clearly why he can and can not talk about specific aspects.

So he wasn't brave enough, you say?

Breadcrumbs, baby!!

Here's the reworked version: I'm an idiot; a clown. I just don't know why Grusch won't tell us because I'm too God damn stupid to understand.

hes repeating the elizondo formula. make all the wildest claims but if asked for evidence "oh my nda hahahaha you know, they would kill me hahaha but hey, did you know we have two aliens in custody called allen and bob? ah they are great fellas!"

[deleted]

Why is this comment being downvoted?😅

when it is revealed that he's a fraud, they'll all act like they never believed him anyway and just move on to their next grifter.

You mean his autism?

It's wild that anyone who even slightly questions these claims gets downvoted. I hope people realize it makes the whole subreddit seem bad. It is so easy to just say stuff. And eye witness testimony, even if he is telling the truth is the lowest possible form of evidence in science. I get so annoyed by this stuff. This is just words.

It's unnatural because he has to be as vague as possible, while still getting a general point across.

yes!! also hes repeating the elizondo formula to the t. •⁠make the most wild claims•⁠when asked about evidence play the "oh my nda haha you know" card•⁠then make more wild claims•⁠collect love and respect from believers these trust me bro folks are really annoying. if you have evidence show it. theres zero chance that you can make all these claims without any problem and that this isnt covered by your NDA but if asked about even the tiniest evidence all of a sudden you arent allowed to say shit. but hey trust me bro haha

There’s a trend of podcasts and YouTube becoming a great source for things like US presidential candidate long form interviews, seemingly factual and minimal bias news like Breaking Points etc. It’s unfortunate “mainstream” media isn’t picking Grusch up. I’m happy to share videos like this with folks to get the word out though!

The DoD would not allow him to present photographic evidence, although he applied to do so.

I've heard a few people say this now and I'm wondering is it his autism? I'm saying that as someone with autism myself, but I personally haven't had any "untrustworthy" alarm bells going off when I watch him talk. I haven't seen this interview yet though so I'll try to be conscious of it and see if I can see what you mean

Yes, I wonder what the exact connection is, but it's fascinating. It is this certain type of people who do whatever they can to be taken seriously and say whatever they can to be seen as important.

Yeah he really seems like a nice guy. Best to go out while you're on top of the game. I'd hate for him to turn out like all the rest of these guys. If he could somehow supply us with those biologicals on his way out though...that'd be perfect :P

Do you know better than both the current and former ICIG?

Trump has literally been the most anti-disclosure president we’ve had in recent times. Grusch’s lawyer is the original ICIG who was appointed by Obama. Why comment on something you clearly know nothing about?

How so? You dont need evidence to come to that conclusion?

first time here? so chuck schumer and everyone involved in proposing the disclosure bill , Obamas inspector general and the current inspector general who deemed grusch "credible and urgent" also fell for his bs then

Low effort, toxic comments regarding public figures may be removed. Public figures are generally defined as any person, organization, or group who has achieved notoriety or is well-known in society or ufology. “Toxic” is defined as any unreasonably rude or hateful content, threats, extreme obscenity, insults, and identity-based hate. Examples and more information can be found here: https://moderatehatespeech.com/framework/.

They literally tried to silence him which is why he has an ongoing whistleblower reprisal investigation by the ICIG.

What are your thoughts on the UAP Disclosure Act?

Grusch? He is on the spectrum so idk what you expect

Why would you be shown the evidence? Do you have a top secret security clearance?

Wipe properly next time.

More like your mom, I guess then.

Lol, you didn't even bother to watch the video. That gives you zero credibility.

I don’t read it the same way. I’m a skeptic and I believe he 100% believes what he is saying.

You're not. You're a skeptic. Nice try.

What is the point of making comments like this if you aren't going to expand on what you said?

[deleted]

If people read your comment over and over they can literally feel their IQ dropping.

Are they pilots?

Barely done any interviews so I doubt it.

You are quite literally talking out of your ass. His whistleblower complaint is currently being investigated by the ICIG, who deemed it ‘urgent and credible’. His claims have already been corroborated by other witnesses, including Karl Nell and Jonathan Grey. Rubio and Gillibrand confirmed that the SSCI has heard from other whistleblowers who have corroborated his claims. Why comment on something you clearly know nothing about?

What book?

Non-human intelligence (the term Grusch uses) is defined in the upcoming NDAA.

This is an important point. As usual it is second or third hand knowledge. Back in the mid 1990’s to early 2000’s it was the same as it was today. The internet was new and it spurred a more public surge in interest. Disclosure was just around the corner then too, all of the same noise, nonsense and non-performance. I want these guys to shut me up by providing proof….and nothing.

So you’re saying you’re ignorant? Fair enough.

Do you think you know better than both the current and original ICIG?

Both the current and former ICIG do. Do you know more than them?

He must be very good at it if he somehow managed to goof on the current and former ICIG.

He has the support of both the current and former ICIG. I expect they know more than you.

I love how they're downvoting you. This man has not given 1 shred of tangible evidence. He is the most vague human being I've ever seen.

Non-human intelligence has a statutory definition.

Least toxic r/all troll. Both the current and former ICIG disagree with you, btw.

Why do the original and current ICIG believe him? Do you think you know better than them?

That can be easily explained by his autism. They briefly mention that he was diagnosed in his 30s.

Why have things gone stagnant? If you have actually paid attention then you should know.

Grusch never backed that video up.

How did you manage to fool both the current and original ICIG?

They really want to believe in something 😞

Do you know better than the current and former ICIG?

Your face is a bad look

He has autism…

this comment from a month old account with 92 Karma? lmaooo

Most people who are passionate about this subject are idiots. From the skeptics who claim everything is a bird or a balloon to people who think aliens have secret agreements with the US government. You’re in the first bucket.

This sub is the laughing stock of Reddit right now.

Then use the bathroom. Stop telling us about your biological needs.

There is a literal disclosure bill going through Congress that uses the phrase ‘non-human intelligence’ over twenty times.

The Italian UFO story was already debunked.

Have you seen the upcoming NDAA?

Have you read the UAP Disclosure Act?

how is he making money

Jesse what the fuck are you talking about

No need to be crass but I'm glad you're better now

Non-human intelligence has a statutory definition.

>dog poo or bull shit

Unfortunately, when he applied with the DoD to provide photographic evidence, they refused.

he did put on his extra crazy face this time

This sub worships the guy. They are so starved and deluded they take his bullshit as gospel.

You made a boo boo. Heres the correct spelling. Staked* You should be aware that many leading figures in the fields of science, mathematics, technology, economics, as well as numerous professors, fall within the autistic spectrum. Does this affect their competence in their respective careers? Not at fucking all.

He is autistic, though? Edit: also, how do Italians or others who tend to speak with their hands make you feel?

Yeah, that good ol' symptom of autism, moving your hands when you talk.

Wait til you find out he has PTSD…

We really do not need ableism to criticise what anyone is saying.

who gives two shits

I'm going to hold you to that. Let's see what happens over the next year or so, see if you are right.

I’d rather trust a whistleblower who’s backed by the ICIG than the people who can’t pass an audit.

He must be a pretty good grifter if he got both the current and former ICIG on his side.

Morons are going to moron.

He brought up the Ariel School incident, in which the NHI were described and even drawn. So make of that what you will.

He explains it. He got approval from DOPSR to say some things and didn't get approval to say other things. That's what he means overdisclose. He doesn't want to go beyond what he already had approval to say. And imho they probably don't want to go back to dopsr and ask for more because they're afraid dopsr will have more scrutiny the second time around or say no to things they already approved.

Sorry they weren't wearing tuxedos or drinking gin in front of a campfire. I guess you might have to just be okay with listening to common/average-looking human beings with different experiences & perspectives to offer. Not everything is gifted inside of a cherry oak box adorned with a silk bow tie. The value isn't in the packaging.

At least we have a timescale now.

The ICIG, the person who vets the whistleblowers, deemed Grusch’s complaint ‘urgent and credible’ and is currently investigating.

He’s autistic.

Greys or Ancient Greys? There is a stark difference.

He could mean there was a 5 gallon bucket filled with human eyes marked "Tuesday".

Really strange choice for a first time comment in r/ufos

Grusch specifically applied with the DoD to provide photographic evidence publicly but was denied.

r/all trolls are some of the most toxic people I’ve ever seen.

Most of us are ready to be wrong. Are you?

> I worked for the NGA and the NRO too lol

The ICIG disagrees with you.

Wow, a military officer suffered from PTSD.

Least toxic r/all troll

Non-human intelligence (the phrase Grusch uses) has a statutory definition.

This definitely looks like a bot account.

This definitely looks like a bot account.

Grusch never said he's writing a book. Fravor doesn't have a book either. You shouldn't spit lies if you want people to care about your opinion lol

Yeah man, tons of bacteria flying fucking spaceships!

pretty piss fucking poor distraction bud. Think about it. If this was a distraction it would be all over ever 247 news feed, just like hunter biden...oh wait, thats right, they have been building this up since the 30's to distract us for a laptop, i forgot...

You mean 100ml?

This sub is fucking acronym hell

David and his team really played some 5D chess here and it's amazing and thorough. I tell people all the time that he is playing the game how it NEEDS to be played and put us and the other whistleblowers in the position of having a true unobstructed as possible route to disclosure.

I believe Grusch is way smarter than I am, and many of all these players, and I now strongly believe he had significant influence on language, topics, rules, and structure of the UAPDA. Even we all seemed to agree the document as written is, unlike almost all Federal law, damn near viciously air tight. It even is worded to prohibit Senate filibuster on appointments, AND it claims binding authority over some aspects of the Executive, AND it’s the most sweeping expansion of eminent domain in quite literally history. And it says outright: there’s NHI/UAP material. The United States Senate declared we have NHI/UAP materials. That’s what nudged me along I want to believe.

Bro’s got the ‘tism and is possibly a couple of steps ahead of the government’s “smartest guys in the room”

He also said he could divulge more if he goes back to Dopsr and asks for approval

We spend all our time and energy, as a planet, in wars so we can control it. Imagine if almost the entirety of the US military budget had been going towards the people and acadamia for the past 50 years. Where could we be?

Most likely they have access to some materials in their world that we dont have

110% my brother is an energy consultant for some big shot company and he said this. "There is a lot of geo-politics involved in the whole fuel technology world. Even if a unconventional fuel source was discovered it would be decades before it is revealed. The reasoning behind that is the massive infrastructure invested into fossil fuels.You can't unwind that in a short time. Any disruptional technology would take a long time to scale and the powers that be would be very careful"

Oil and gas got us here.

It's my opinion too. An almost unforgivable crime if true. This would mean that environmental destruction could have been avoided from the start. Now imagine that they also have medical technology that can cure any illness or injury. Humanity is left in suffering because of profit and the money system.

I’ve always felt this was at the least something to do with it

More and more I think about the thing holding us back are the energy industries and just the overall economic effects of releasing the technology, if what we're able to do with it is that transformational.Maybe the secrecy used to protect religion too, but now it's just about money. And power.edit: and I'm learning a lot lately about the history of DOE involvement

Not at all... The US wants money and power. Oil, a foreign resource, is NOT something we want to rely on. And the amount of power and wealth that would come from having energy sources greater than oil, would cause us to immediately ditch oil and switch over. We'd gladly ditch oil and become the dominate global player. The amount of wealth is ridiculous.

Apparently JP Morgan (the guy) shut down Teslas (the guy) experiment on basically free wireless energy bc he had already invested a ton in a rubber plantation that would make him even richer for supplying the rubber needed for power cables. I don't doubt that better tech has been shelved to keep profits up.

My impression of the purpose of this more casual youth friendly setting (with a somewhat annoying interviewer) was for more strategic reasons, not really to give new information. I think team disclosure is trying to play a high level media game, and just think of what we could push if we had young people interested in this topic. They are loud and they have tik tok, not the UAP shape or the candy but the dag gum app.

I hear what your saying. It did kinda seem like 'bros hanging out' It was also an expansive conjecture on everything that has been discussed in various forms together and separately and while it doesn't offer anything specifically new ( the energy tie-ins have certainly been hinted ) it *was* a more long form piece that brings more people to the topic. It also may have been a refresher for some and the continued conversation can only be a good thing. We all see more and more interest in this and shows like this have to help that along. And it was *sure as hell* better than the Cowboys/Giants game! Sweet Jesus Christ what a beatdown!

At the beginning it was said the interviewer has known Grusch for years. It leads me to believe this is not their first discussion on the matter and the interviewer is asking about things they have discussed previously.

Totally agree. Entitled tweens with a camera, mic and LED lighting in their bedrooms and access to leading figures but with no experience or talent in interviewing.

I totally agree. This interviewer was annoying as hell. It seemed like he wanted to interview himself. This interview should be edited down to 20 minutes.

He made an analogy to it, thats why i included it

Their brains would be totally physically different than ours. We would have begun from unique abiogenesis. We aren’t even cousins a trillion times removed. The entire human concept of insight and intuition may not even have an equivalent mapping to any comparable concepts for them. We would be the same to them. They may have a concept of thought that no human ever, anywhere, has even dreamed of. Or they’re just like us, except they banged different elements together.

Omg he did bring up China multiple multiple times in this interview…..

No, now we want to see his claims verified, as with any other claims. They are very interesting claims indeed though

I believe Grusch is being honest about his assessment of the evidence he was presented, but to be fair, the overwhelming majority of UAP footage we see posted here really is just balloons, satellites, drones, bats, etc.

\> With power being transmitted over the air. Computers and micro ships would be an impossibility. You might be interested in [Wolfram's Ruliad](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/), and everything around the ideas of a computational universe. Lex Fridman has some great [interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-SGpEInX_c) with him (took me several listens each), where he talks about it. His example, that fits yours well, is that we would never come up with the second law of thermodynamics if we could perceive all the gas atoms, and their velocities, simultaneously. Most of what we come up with is because we have very limited perception, and tools. "Higher intelligences" wouldn't even see or consider the models that we come up with, because they would see the "truth" of how the universe works. There's is an underlying reality (defined by the Ruliad), but our form of intelligence exists only because we are limited to a small space in the possibilities.

"plenty of evidence" ok lol

He mentioned tech separately, he might not have been meaning "more advanced technologically" and instead maybe is talking about their biology, perhaps?

That is admittedly a proven military strategy... but at the same time, we could be even more useful to them as allies for future galactic endeavors. If even some of the claims are accurate, that could explain why they have held back and let us gradually become accustomed to the idea of interstellar neighbors. They could also have a set of guidelines similar to how we would treat undeveloped tribes of humans living in the wilds. Better to just leave them in peace for now, or gradually see if they are open to communication/trade, than to simply wipe them out because they might eventually figure out blacksmithing and gunpowder.

That assumes they could. If it's true, there's also implications that we possess the ability to shoot them down. And it also suggests that their weapon capabilities may be limited or non-existant, which is one of many possible explanations of their tendency to just run away as opposed to defending themselves. Of course larpers on 4chan claim they can disintegrate matter remotely. But you know, 4chan larp. But I think there's always this assumption that Aliens could just end existence on earth instantaneously or at least without much effort. I'd argue that there isn't any evidence to suggest that in the slightest and if we're operating under the assumption that they exist, and the various shipwrecks/shoot downs are true, that suggests the opposite, or at least demonstrates a great hesitancy in doing such a thing.

> shadow biome theory The crash that happened in 1933 was supposedly a bonafide rocket of some sort with nuts bolts and rivets. it was so human like it was thought to be from Germany

I didnt mean Lazar in particular but the claims he made

And what if they never even split the atom. They could be both fascinated and terrified by us. And vice versa.

Wow, incredible to consider eh?

And also what we've subjected these creatures to, the lies, the coverups, the disinformation, and the demonization and targeting of anyone who finds out the wrong thing or gets too close to the truth.

It’s gonna be a huge scandal. Hidden tech that could’ve given us “free” energy decades ago. Pollution and inequality wouldn’t be as bad as now if that tech was let out. It’s already confirmed the government gave this tech to private companies. It’s gonna make watergate look like a piece of cake.

I think it’s more that the entire concept of religion is wrong and made up but some key elements of it are actually true in a completely different sense

Also, who they’ve murdered over early disclosure…

I believe it would be more about human abduction and cross breading. Hybrids among us.

…who has been shot in the back of the head behind a warehouse in keeping this secret for 80 years, etc… haha

The real baggage will come when we find out that they've stashed the 'biologic evidence' IN. Our. FOOD!! Ahhhhhhhhggg JK

Or, the "baggage" relates to our own perceptions of reality. My wild speculation is erring toward us discovering that these NHI craft contain human biologics, which are operated by NHI. That would be pretty terrifying because there would be no way to distinguish them, even if they were right in front of you. And also that our bodies could be hijacked.

Here I am imagine literal body bags of these grey homies (RIP)

Baggage probably relates to deities and prophets throughout religious history. Everything from the Greeks and Romans all the way through to Jesus, Mohammad and other modern day equivalents. Imagine if those NHI just showed up and the world realizes they were just sent to guide us and keep us from destroying each other. Religions would collapse, whole segments of society would falter. That's a lot of baggage.

i think baggage refers to something more substantial than where it is stashed and who owns it. I think the baggage refers to how they obtained the biologics. My suspicion is that we have shot down craft and killed pilots in the process. Zoom out on the issue for the general public who is unaware. They have to explain how they have been secretly conducting first contact on behalf of humanity. “Guess what: We are not alone! Oh, and by the way, we have engaged this incredibly advanced civilization in hostile acts of war.”

Or perhaps the fact that they are spiritual or partly spiritual entities (demonic).

Or maybe something like [this?](https://thejournalofcosmology.com/Puthoff.pdf)

Big G God: The Supreme Being. The ultimate master and judge of this thing we call reality. From which all things come and to which all things return. Little G gods: Advanced ETs, or perhaps spiritual entities (and really, what’s the difference besides semantics?), that we bowed down and worshipped at one time due to the sheer awe of their powers. Perhaps they’re less like angels and demons in Christianity, or even gods and goddesses in pagan religions, and more like the Djinn in Islam. Which is what I’ve recently been leaning towards, the more I hear about all this. Djinni (yes, like Aladdin’s genie, that’s the creature Will Smith was portraying) are not necessarily supernatural, or unnatural at all, just another intelligent being Allah created from smokeless fire, while he created mankind from clay. Which were granted different natural capabilities than us, such as the ability to travel extremely fast, turn invisible and shapeshift, or appear in multiple places at once. Since Djinni are said to have their own communities, they may have developed civilizations alongside, or independent of, humanity and/or climbed a separate, tech tree. Djinni have finite, albeit very long, lifespans of hundreds or even thousands of years, different tribes, factions, and even follow different religions. While coexisting, for better or worse or neutral, alongside us in this physical realm in a way we simply don’t ordinarily perceive. They can periodically cross over through their own power, one of us calling them, or some other event.

It's significant in a manner of speaking, yes. 2-3 thousand years ago would we be capable of understanding the difference?

it's a common way of speaking about the subject. So I wouldn't say so.

Maury: And the test results show..... Aliens.... you ARE the father! Humans: ***runs backstage crying*** NHI: ***sits there scowling at the booing audience***

Can you imagine writing history? Who would not want to be that guy?

“No one knows what it means, but it’s provocative… it’s gets the people going!”

If aliens crashed and were dead, it's kinda not a problem. If they were ALIVE and we kept them captured? That's some hell of a baggage.

It means that much of our "history" is false and that disclosure will leave you questioning everything.

I think he's saying that there are going to be a lot of feelings and opinions about how we dealt with the biological material we found, wether it was respectfully as possible or something ugly.

In my opinion, it means he’s full of shit. If he has evidence that he wants to put out he would put it out. If he has what he says he has, he would go down in history as THE man to expose extra terrestrial life. This whole it’s not my job, the people aren’t ready shit is straight from the grifters playbook. He basically says “I want to reveal enough to make people ask questions but I’m not going to share any answers because that’s not my job.” Please..

they share a large part of our DNA. think about the implications

enter terrific ink air aware plant complete shelter sink overconfident ` this message was mass deleted/edited with redact.dev `

Nothing it’s just a way to avoid giving any specifics that people could verify.

It means he's a grifter who wants to trick people who don't understand the laws of physics (or indeed, the laws of the United States) into paying attention to him.

It doesn't mean anything. It means he's just saying shit to stay in the spotlight but he doesn't have any actual proof and never will.

Basically still trying to get attention for whatever grift he’s got going on

In relationships it can mean unresolved issues. Suggests to me a history of involvement, and that people in the know will have some 'splaining to do.

I think he's just saying that people are going to have a lot of opinions and feelings about how they dealt with the issue

Biden is going to release the details. He doesn’t want to steal thunder.

Because we have nothing to be afraid of. The bad ones have been kicked off planet. The war had already been won. The only thing left to happen is for each individual human to make their choice. Some bad info about our past will be a tough pill to swallow but it's the past. It happened. It's time to move on.

It's always "I'm not telling you the big picture" because the more they lie the more they have to remember

I'm nostalgic for a pre 9/11 world..call me old fashioned

I’ve quietly wondered the same. What happens when a large portion of the 84% of the world that identifies as religious or believes in a god suddenly does not? Do things get better or worse when some people lose their moral compass?

Just stop. You complain when there’s no disclosure. You complain when there is. This is reality. Stop feeding into the anti reality argument

I already am and I've always wanted this! But we're getting interdimensionals. From what I understand, extraterrestrials still aren't on the table? Everything else is but that? But yeah, regardless if they're from here, there, or inbetween space, I've always wanted something this, at least. It's been not even two months and I'm wishing for the old timeline already believe it or not. It's just a lot. It's going to be a lot. I think I went down the correct rabbit hole (or close to it) of what we have on our hands and where we might be headed, and it just... Nevermind. Forget it. Let's just hope for the best and also just not forget where we came from. It's about to get fucking CRAZY. Hold on to your butts. Hope I'm way off on all that.

this makes the most sense to me. not nearly upvoted enough, good thought

Or they're using biological vessels to interact with our dimension, or dimensions don't work quite the way we propose they might.

The correct answer to the baggage is the recovered entities have monster size dicks.

Ah yes, we definitely *know* that..

To be fair, it is a well working business model, just look at how religions work, religious claims are even much wilder and not even appropriate for our development level and yet. The IQ spectrum of the general population is so wide and commonly assumed to be low on average and there is an incredibly large number of individuals moving on the lower half of the average. No matter how wild some idea may be, you will find someone believing in it and then there are the people who see value in that and take advantage of it by exploiting said people

Or we just chill the fuck out before declaring every story ever as real

"would now be real until I'm told otherwise." Why would you believe random mythologies without evidence for them?

“You guys, I found some really retarded apes” honestly I feel they’ve been here all along as more time goes by.

Their fave show is planet earth

Some of them might've already slipped a note for us to WAKE UP but we brushed it off

If they're smart enough to travel to and find us, they've no doubt come across other forms of life or civilization. We probably are just one of many they've observed. Probably not much different for them than when we get those "_______ new species discovered last year" NatGeo articles

We've also been told "Beware the Bearers of False Gifts" in crop circles... yikes

More likely they needed to land their ship to do repairs and a bunch of children happened to see them.

depending on the watch, there can be multiple data points to be gained from it, date and time being the most obvious, which then can translate into other data points such as location

Have you watched the Cave of Bones doc on Netflix about Homo naledi? They were burying their dead approximately 125 thousands years before us. It's an interesting thought experiment to consider how much of a head start that is.

it could be that we could be completely different species but our technological development took a different turn than our path did. The common thread could be literally anything because it is so vague.

well where the hell did they go then? this theory makes no sense. No human type biology could live underground or underwater. And if they had to flee to do so because of predation, they would of had the tech to obliterate the predator. wtf gives. unless they are some sort of Human that fled the planet or sought shelter with the assistance of technology from sort of massive disaster and we are the survivors of that catastrophe and they are on their way back after so many years to reclaim the planet or re-integrate with us secretly. Or maybe a race amongst us on this planet now is them doing this

I suppose, however any religious institution can spin it however they please that would naturally benefit them. Always political in the end as opposed to truly spiritual when it comes to organized religion. Also on the other hand, people would believe whatever they want, so i think that problem would solve itself eventually, it all depends on who is able to exert education and/or control over the narrative first. I’m not really concerned or worried about it, for example, the vatican ruled that any aliens should be regarded on the same level as fellow humans also as god’s creation. Shows an example of adaptation. There are also people who believe the earth is flat and that dinosaur bones are actually dragon bones. Society has not collapsed because of their uniquely illogical beliefs.

I think he meant Jeremy Corbell

and what did he say grusch would do...?

My understanding, based on his LinkedIn and comments he’s made, is that he is (or at least was) an investor at Thiel Capital, which also employs Eric Weinstein. Thiel was one of the minds behind PayPal and is a bit of a controversial figure.

Conversation about the why of the beginning starts aroun 20:00 mark. There’s a call out of all the guys that created the classification system. It goes into further scientists that were involved in anti-gravity as well as about the DOE Atomic energy bill which restricts all use and or development of things that remotely look like radioactive isotopic radiation. Unless approved by the government. String theory is suspected of being a psyop because it can’t be measured and it pulls you in deep with no real proof and it was created by the son of one of the scientists that started the current secrecy program. Great to hear folks who have a grasp of these topics talk about how fucked up things really are… furthers the fact that people like Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, Nikola Tesla were rare birds. Science just doesn’t get people like that often and for the most part it’s a group activity.

Grusch literally asked the DoD if you he could provide photographic evidence publicly, and they refused. Why is this so hard to grasp?

How do you steal evidence out of the most secure top secret facilities in the world? You think they let you bring your phone in there or a little disposable camera? Not everybody thinks he’s a clown, stop being such a hater if you’re browsing the UFO subs.

[removed]

This response has the vibe of a salesman, spouting nonsense and insulting people.

Yes

It's not that they want him to say what he says, he submitted it for review and if they denied him the ability to talk they would have to specify what things he says are classified showing there's something to it, in the interview he explains this catch-22. But sure downplay it as disinformation, the evidence can't just be brought out in public there's the ongoing investigation by the ICIG

oh i’m sure you would break your security clearance and subject yourself to prison for decades if you ever were in his shoes. thank god we have u/lowkickMT being a real patriot shitting on whistleblowers comfortably from his mothers couch without any skin in the game at all

Grusch gave a new phrase that I found interesting: "It's not my job." This definitely has some Elizondo vibes. Especially with him giving all sorts of wild theories in a way that makes it seems like he's seen something that led him to those theories. I wouldn't be surprised if, when someone pushes for him to provide evidence, he says "I was just giving my theory. I never said I had any proof." Unfortunately people here seem satisfied with getting the theories without getting to see the evidence that led to them.

Why not just leave the sub? “Collect love and respect from believers” sounds as though you’re just wasting your own time being here. You also clearly lack understanding of what’s happening. He isn’t speaking about anything he hasn’t already been cleared to speak about by the defense review board, so he hasn’t said anything classified publicly. You say there’s “zero chance” when you don’t know. That’s your opinion that’s also misinformed because you left out the part where he got permission before speaking out. Ufo information is classified, to the point that congress even has trouble getting access to it. So in light of that, you just expect someone like Elizondo who doesn’t even have it in his possession to drop it on YouTube?? That just screams a lack of understanding on the processes of how this actually works.

infinitely dangling carrot

Please do better. Grusch is distinct from Elizondo in how he approached this. He gave evidence to a congressional committee he had learned about, to the extent DOD authorized him to do so, and offered to give names, dates, locations, etc. The ball is now in the committee’s court to answer back to the public on their findings. Is your response really in good faith here?

[removed]

So much this. "Let's circlejerk forever, guys! " Every single one on of these "I know but can't tell you." Bullshit artists over here with less bravery than any corporate whistle-blower that's actually brought receipts and risked their lives. There are "Me Too" actresses with more skin in the game.

I think they mean well, but they could also be unwittingly useful for spreading disinformation... Just a bad mix of charisma and credulity, waiting to be pointed in the wrong direction and take the rest of the lemmings with them.

How’d that go for Snowden? Y’all really propped him up as a hero, huh

False dichotomy fallacy

My problem is he was cleared to say this, if they were going to lock him up they wouldn't have give him the go ahead to say what he has.

Curiously, the Gov would have to admit to having aliens if they prosecuted him for leaking that evidence.

I would be ok with that lol but now all I can think about is Rick and Morty's engine (miniverse/microverse/tinnieverse) where they live to generate power for his car lol

I agree

Yep. I find him very attractive.

This problem started HERE with the whole Dave Grusch thing. Wich makes me lean towards a certain direction when people ask how its become this Bad. Its not just trolls. Its trolls paid by taxes. Check the Accounts for a while and you'll start to see a pattern.

Do you think the govt is giving a flying fuck about how Clean your schools, universities and Hospital are? If they would, you wouldnt Go Into debt for a Lifetime Just because you have medical issues. Come Back to reality. Check some leaked documents and you'll find out that they'd rather use all the manpower they have for spying on and manipulating citizens (Not just their own) lol

Yes.

Saying that no evidence has come out is just patently false, for starters... That's just a ridiculous statement. There have been numerous leaks over time

I don't know why but this comment doesn't sit right with me. Seems like a troll trying to create doubt in peoples minds by casting dispersions on a decorated veteran while hiding behind anonymity and a keyboard.

Okay my Guy/Girl. *place a shoulder shrugging Emoji here*

And Reddit removed the blog post outing them! Don't trust the admins either lol

Unfortunately I’ve noticed that even the comments that will get downvoted to -20 or -30 are still not removed by mods. They seem to be very lenient on the rules of the sub.

There’s a huge amount of staunch skeptics on this site since all this started popping off aggressively denying the validity of any of it. They can never give you a good reason why it’s honestly bizarre behavior. I don’t go on ghost or Bigfoot thread’s trying to debunk people because I don’t believe in that shit why would I?

It's valid to believe in contact, conspiracy, Grusch and also not believe in Knapp, Corbell, Lazar, etc.

>Don't you have something you enjoy you could be engaging in? That's just it. They enjoy engaging in this way. They enjoy ridiculing and diminishing the views, beliefs, and opinions of others. They enjoy exuding negative energy.

To be fair people lead miserable lives and like to attack that which they don’t understand.

If true, the disclosure will be the most significant news in the world, ever. The discussion should be open to everyone, since it potentially affects everyone. Scepticism is warranted in my opinion. The side that makes these claims could end all scepticism quite easily, if they're speaking the truth. Just release the evidence. But us who call not releasing the evidence suspect and waste of time are not 'valid'?

You can be interested in UFOs and discussing in UFOs without being convinced that there are aliens visiting our planet.

This was on the front page when you are not logged in. It has been getting picked up by all for the last few months. That's why you are seeing skeptical people. Honestly if he has evidence of aliens just release it. This is more important than one man. However non-human biologics is most biologics on this earth. I see trees in the background, they are not human. Why not say extra-terrestrial if that's what he's implying? Give it a few months, this guy is trying to sell a book or something.

because this sub keeps showing up on /r/all

But attacking someone and name calling them for how they look, or how big they are doesn’t give any credibility to the discussion. It’s just a distraction from who he is and what he has said since his initial interview with Ross Coulthart. You don’t need to trust him and that’s completely fine. We shouldn’t worship any UFO figureheads.

He is autistic.

No, same here. I've never not been on team Grusch yet this clip gave me "pushing an agenda" vibes. I'm also growing extremely super tired of the "can't say more". Actually in this clip he's not even saying that, he's saying that saying more isn't his job. Wtf

Just because you haven’t seen the evidence, does not dismiss the fact that the phenomenon is a real issue going on. If you aren’t informed in the subject, there are a lot of great starting points. You don’t need to be interested in the ET hypothesis to know that the pentagon fails their audits and loses billions upon billions of dollars a year in secret access programs known as SAP’s. It would be pretty shocking if all the people who have come forward were all lying. After all, the government doesn’t need to create lies about UFOs to gather more funding for their war machine.

WTF? Human testimony gets people the electric chair. No sure why people always fucking say it’s the worst form of evidence. There’s plenty of circumstantial evidence here and that gets you convicted in a court of law beyond a reasonable doubt

there are a million possibilities as to what that could mean. endless honeydicking.

[deleted]

You're not at all wrong

Well someone paid for the fcc botnet during netneutrality. Maybe someone paid for this one from a defense contractor. If they were this shitty and overt they probably shouldn't have any govt contracts

You're thinking of Vannevar Bush, but he was not related (except maybe distantly) to the Bush family that produced two US presidents.

I agree, debunkers should stop making insulting claims about whistleblowers who they know nothing about.

They are even written the same 😂

Low effort comments earn low effort responses.

If I was a legal whistleblower and I knew that the news I’m breaking was going to be revealed through the legal channels in the coming months then I’d definitely be doing what Dave Grusch is right now. The illegal whistleblowers, while doing the right thing, are living lives in exile. Better to just play it safe and let all the real classified information come out in the wash, imo. If you’re here on the UFO sub try to be a little more open minded.

Why? He would remain anonymous to the public which would make him lose credibility but the government/intelligence community who has been the real threat would be able to figure out who he is. Going public means people know him and it's harder for "them" to smear him. I don't agree with your point of view here.

Because he's going through the legally defined channels of whistleblowing classified information so as not to be arrested. If he went the Snowden route he would be arrested or need to flee. He is not a whistleblower in the sense you think. As stated before, he already has evidence that was handed over, and he is not the one with first hand knowledge. He has been informed by many other people, who are said to be coming forward as well. Once that happens, it should really pick up, but we'll have to wait and see.

No it wouldnt. Pls stfu or give a reasonable Argument or example for the horseshit youre talking

I hear "US inspector general" thrown around a lot on this sub, so I did some research and found that this quote is not what most people think it is. The IG simply states that a process is in place and that Grusch needs to follow that process.

There was US general who believed that US army must train soldiers to go trough walls and bemd spoons with power of brain. So yes, Generals can be stupid and go crazy. And thatbone was General of intelligence who served well.

He believes Grusch that he was retaliated against or discriminated against, not that there are aliens. All Grusch has done in an official capacity is say "This is that people have told me, this is what they've given me as their evidence." To give a comical example, someone could tell Grusch that an alien abducted them from Denny's, and then their evidence is a Walmart receipt that says "aliens r real." Grusch can then relay that story and submit that person's evidence and he's not lying, just reporting on what he was told. In an unofficial capacity it seems like he's realized he can make bank off this so he's starting to ham up the media circuit. In the end he'll end up just as kooky as every other previously highly regarded UFO guy, but he won't give a shit because he'll be rich af.

It’s not just him saying this. It doesn’t help that the media at large are continuously misreporting this. Marco Rubio has said there are “many” high-ranking officials testifying to the same thing as Grusch, with firsthand knowledge or involvement. And then there are the proposed laws that no one apparently knows about. This is what happens in an information vacuum.

Most of his claims are just UFO lore talking points that have been peddled by grifters and quacks for decades.

I mean who can argue that endless honeydicking is going on

He’s already explained why he can say certain things.

I never said that either. Many of you like to put words in others mouths. You also don't know my beliefs. A lot of assuming and condescending to me is low effort

It's pointless. Some of the comments are wild, too. "If aliens are real, that means from here on out unless proven otherwise, all other things like Bigfoot and djinn are real now, too (paraphrased)." Like, what in the fuck, how do you get to there from here? It's alarming how easy people just decide that's how science and proof work.

Dismissing it without evidence = low thinking. Didnt say I believed.

The government has been lying to you, so now you trust the government isn't lying to you... because they are telling you to your face that they have been lying to you the whole time... just not THIS time... this time they are telling you the truth... about how much they lie. But not this time, this time it's the TRUTH! Wanna buy a bridge?

He's holding back because his safety is in danger but he keeps talking and putting his safety in danger.

specify top dod intelligence officer you all act as if he was a number 3 or something like that

Why do you make that sound like it's some sort of improbability? The government lies and conducts malfeasance constantly. FFS didn't we just endure 20 years of two wars, one of which was based entirely off of a bold faced lie that people like Grusch pushed and doubled down on to gain the public's consent?

lmao yeah it's enforced so tightly that politicians get away with leaking classified information(Intentionally or otherwise) constantly.

He did reveal the Mussolini UFO retrieval. You can look it up. He even repeated Billy Brophys claims, which are constantly changing and aren't supported by evidence. It's not looking good for Gruschs credibility, when the only real operation he's revealed is such nonsense.

How convenient! He just has to say, "there's secret ufo stuff - i can't say more, it's classified". And lots of people will say, "wow, it must be true! So brave!" - even though they are never shown anything.

Any source on the ICIG report coming out soon? Because if I were you I wouldn't put my hopes on the deadline put up by the letter sent by those 3 representatives. Afaik there hasn't been any talk of a report coming out soon from their investigation. What if they come out and say they've found nothing? Would everyone here at that point call Grusch a liar or gullible? Or would they say they haven't found anything because it's all been moved to another facility and the legacy program has once again been obfuscated? Not trying to smear on David here, I'm just being curious.

>Lol, relax, none of these folks can disclose anything that's still classified This is total bullshit. If the information was society-changing, as Grusch says it us, they should just spill the beans for the good of humanity. Edward Snowden did it and it wasn't even about aliens.

'I can't answer any hard questions, or back up even a single claim of mine because...uh...muh national security!'

they can just take the fall and get arrested plenty of others would, they are cowards

What you're missing is that people need to see evidence to believe something. Claiming you're not allowed to show evidence doesn't remove that need.

I don’t think people understand how the disclosure of classified information works… this guy would be dead in a few weeks if he just let it rip. I’m sure his house phone and car are all bugged. He probably has a surveillance van outside his house 24/7. I can’t imagine the stress of being the guy willing to take the legal route to force the governments hand towards disclosure; he must be walking on egg shells every waking moment of his life

I don’t give a rat’s ass what his so called reasons are. Classified who the fuck cares.

Careful, if you don't bootlick a [professional liar that's conducted information warfare for years](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/GO/GO06/20230726/116282/HHRG-118-GO06-Bio-GruschD-20230726.pdf) then you get mass downvoted here by zealots that just take 'important government man' at face value if he says something they want to hear.

So what? Oh no he's under oath! You act like this just magically makes him honest. First off, he's making wild claims and offloading the responsibility for proving them onto unnamed entities, so even if he's lying there's no actual repercussion because he's managed to keep plausible deniability this entire time. Second off, the fact you think an oath means a damn thing in the US government of all organizations is utterly beyond naive.

>He testified under oath before congress. And you don't have any way of knowing what was said in that testimony.

Okay, laws have definitely stopped everyone from committing crimes so now I have to believe him!

The sub has a very large contingent of people that treat ufology as a religion. Grusch is telling them what they want to hear so they simply take anything he says at face value, then engage in appeals to authority whenever anyone isn't bootlicking him, let alone daring to actually question the honesty of a man who's spent years [working](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/GO/GO06/20230726/116282/HHRG-118-GO06-Bio-GruschD-20230726.pdf) in disinfo and information warfare. The truth hurts, and the truth is more likely that this is all kabuki theater similar to blue book, rather than the option that the government is going to snitch on itself for unbelievable crimes while also giving up a tech advantage.

High functioning 'tism (' spergers) with a 130+IQ but does not know how to social would actually make perfect sense with a 14year military and intelligence career where everything is regulated and legislated... His autistic ass tries to put a mask on for the normies by saying "Fk" and "dude" a lot but he's still incredibly uncomfortable when exposed to the public 🤷‍♂️ instead of hanging around in pentagon back offices

It bugs me the BS on this sub continuously makes Reddit front page and isn't mass downvoted. The vote percent on this is currently around 80%, which isn't great but still means 8 out of 10 people voting on this post upvoted it. Reddit is just full of morons. Imagine a lot of teens, drop outs, and mind rotted [NEETs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEET) hang out here all day, most other people are too busy to spend so much time here.

Non-autistic here, excellent people-reading skills. On the contrary, his mannerisms, facial expressions etc. appear trustworthy.

Does a former psychiatric patient with a documented history of mental illness?

That's more than the moron in the video.

Ofc he's a skeptic

You don't understand who plays basketball with one ball in each hand? The Harlem Globetrotters. And who is the enemy of the Harlem Globetrotters? The Washington Commanders. COMMANDERS OF WHAT? I'll tell you what, the Space Force. WAKE UP SHEEPLE

>TylerDurdenWin just wanna say i appreciate you bodying these people who haven't read a thing about this , ignoring the senate bill is the only evidence you need tbh

Literally anyone knows more than random internet guy! This is the kind of thinking that gets believers in trouble. Just because he has an ounce more credibility than a random voice from the internet does not mean he is credible. Listen to the guy speak. He is exagerating what he knows. None of these people have any credibility. That is why this is not a big story on CNN. Those whores at CNN AND FOX would be all over an alien story and pushing it at 8 oclock every day but even they apparently have some standards, low as they might be. Keep hope alive my friend but remember that a lack of evidence to the contrary is not evidence of a conspiracy.

Grusch specifically asked to provide photographic evidence, but the DoD refused.

Who said they believe him. https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2023/06/13/claims-made-by-ufo-whistleblower-david-grusch-are-pure-science-fiction/?sh=548445503a41

considering his testimony is a bunch of I heard from a dude who heard from a dude, yeah I probably do know just as much. the UFO community is filled with grifters just like the 9/11 truther community. guy goes on newsnation to talk about recovered bodies but under oath he changes tune. too classified to talk about in a hearing but absolutely fine to spill the beans to some literal whos? absolutely shocked I say 2 more weeks etc

[removed]

Another piece of evidence that will most certainly be made public any day now…

Incorrect.

Deluded? You might want to check the upcoming NDAA.

Yeah, so here’s the thing. A guy who worked for the government, talked to other people who worked at the government, who said aliens are real. Then he went to the dod and was like “can I say that aliens are real”, and the dod said “well u can’t say anything top secret or anything like that, but you can say aliens are real”. That just says to me that none of this is real and this guys a liar. If it was real, the dod wouldn’t let him talk about it at all, nor would they pick this guy as their spokesperson. He’s a clout chaser at best.

That doesn’t answer the paradox. If he goes over what they “approved” him to say and they prosecute him for it, that is an admittance that it is true. If they are so desperate to deny and keep these things secret why would they do that exactly? It makes no sense

I think all greys ancient or recent are biological robots. I believe human looking extraterrestrials created us and use the grey robots for certain tasks. I can't believe I'm getting down voted so much :(

The guy has netflix specials where he takes peoples money and pretends he can summon UFOs. He is the worst cook grifter of the UFO community and all around a bad look if the point is to gain any legitimacy. I get that what he is saying sounds so interesting and would be amazing if true, but PLEASE research this guy he is nothing short of a lunatic and con artist!

Yeah because alien life doesn't exist here on Earth. I could request anything I want, but it doesn't mean it exists. It's all a show and you're all lapping it all up because you're desperate for it to be true. In reality, you should be thinking critically about this and think how little sense it makes in the grand scheme of the universe.

My first boss was an NGA guy named Mr. Padilla, he was so bad they moved him to the JIC and replaced him with a navy CMDR. You don't know what the NGA is though, you don't understand what the NRO does or even what a DD214 is. All you know is ✋️ALIENS🤚 Which is how this grift works, same reason why this guy gets away with this scam.

Calling out medical idiots isn't toxic. Mental health hygiene is important and this sub is filled with people who need to use a deodorant for starters. PS. I don't care about your and your mates opinion. Even patients' opinion is important as they usually seek help. People who make out of any touch of reality lengthy comments here feel like they are fine and do not need help despite their obvious incompetence and overall mediocrity in everything except flamboyant narcissism. Losers.

No, I’m a real person. I just think the UFO disclosure stuff is a lot of nothing.

There's a book on amazon telling his story, he will be earning money from it.What has he exactly said factual to back up anything he has said?? Enlighten me.Hes just in the lime light, talking about fairytales earning money.He 100% didn't do any interview for free..Correct me if I'm wrong

Rick and morty writers could mine these comments for $s

I'm not sure what clause you are referring to, but, e.g.: > EXERCISE OF EMINENT DOMAIN.—The Federal23 Government shall exercise eminent domain over any and24 all recovered technologies of unknown origin and biological25 evidence of non-human intelligence that **may** be controlled1 by private persons or entities in the interests of the public2 good.

He mentions uapda in the video and nothing he says implies he had a hand in it. I dont see why he would omit that information if it was the case.

Are you at all worried that your opinion that "Grusch is way smarter than I am" may lead you to dismiss questionable actions and stories from him that would be considered red flags if they were coming from someone you consider less reputable?

Grush needs to wake up. You just don’t go to a Senate hearing with such claims that could change the entire Humanity and than say i just wanted to put a „Flag“ out there. Fuk your Flag, we have enough „Flags“ already, we need to see the rest of the Ship. You don’t get to throw a Nuke like that on us than hide your hand. Fuk that.

And he's Autistic so that puts him in an intellectual and honest league above many.

>The United States Senate declared we have NHI/UAP materials. What? No they haven't. What world are you living in?

No he’s not. He’s just captured by the ufo liars. The guy is larping.

"And it says outright: there’s NHI/UAP material." Doesn't it say "if" there is material?

I actually don’t think it was Grusch who made the Senate amendment so strong. His insights and knowledge would definitely help with parts, but things like eminent domain and appointments? You’d need someone with legislative experience. Ideally someone who had been staff to a committee. But also someone with experience in the executive branch, who would know how they would attempt to circumvent the law. Who ticks those boxes? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Mellon

I think so too. This girl also got the ‘tism and I get a brain boner hearing him talk. He is *way* smarter than most people I know.

The difference would be staggering...it boggles the mind to even contemplate.

What would happen if every country on the planet collectively decided that every cent spent on Defence will now be spent on healthcare and education as well as bringing up the standard of living for all while also minimising climate impact. And every billionaire would be allowed 1 single billion, with the rest being redistributed to this project. Climate impact will automatically be reduced within 50 years by the introduction of much cleaner technologies anyway. Once countries are fixed they can then focus on helping other countries. It would be glorious. I mean, short of forcing everyone to play nice with a magic mind control button and not automatically just attack each other with the weapons they already have once the defence spending stops, it’s not possible. But imagine if it was.

The one and only "positive" aspect of war is that it pushes innovation. At least this is an argument I heard and can SOMEHOW accept. But yes, I'm fully with you and believe we would be much further with all that budget on education and research, in a peacefull way.

The thought is somber: we have wasted so much time destroying the planet and killing each other when we could have been working together as 1.

Amen… Imagine if our planet as a whole worked towards human advancement instead of nationalistic and territorial control. Good god we’d be so much better off.

The 3 body problem second bill tackles a version of this concept. If all of humanity invested entirely in science technology and military and almost none in humanity, where would we be in 100, 200, 300 years.

Isnt tht exacly why some came forward because they fed up with the slow progress this is making due to not more scientist figuring it out Its wild blows my mind really, also the whole uranium thing behind it are we being mined is it a trade why they crashed some crafts for us to study, how they shot down the fake nukes Urianium is not on every planet and maybe they need it for something and dont have acces to it on theirs

there is more money to be made in destruction of civilizations and then some in the rebuilding, than in general progress. Man is greedy.

Service to self vs Service to others. I think about this a lot. The law of one may be of interest to you, and honestly all on this sub.

There could be EVEN more genders lol

I think that's a gross oversimplification. We've been fighting and killing each other long before recorded history began. It has nothing to do with oil­.

Speaking Russian.

We would be speaking german, russian or chinese and spending equal amounts of money making sure it stays that way.

You would be speaking Russian or Chinese.

literally countless trillions of dollars we could have used on humanity

Who’s We….

We would be in the Star Trek reality we deserve

Unless we destroy ourselves that mindset is still an inevitability, I think no matter what the collective goal of humanity will *at some point* be space colonization and the borders between us physically, governmentally, etc. will evaporate and we will be "one country" with that one goal.

>past 50 years I get what you're saying and DOD spending being outrageous, but that type of open democratic academic research doesn't work so well in a USSR or other top-down system. So we kind of need some of that military budget to enable the environment conducive to academic inquiry.

The cynical answer is if the US spent all its defense budget on something else, then China or Russia would invade the US and takeover the country. May not get a chance to spend all that money for something better.

> Imagine if almost the entirety of the US military budget had been going towards the people and acadamia for the past 50 years. We have like....0.00000000008 of the military budget going into academia and all its engendered is Marxism. Get the government out of academic institutions outright.

If it weren't for the presence of coal, and that concentrated energy, humans would not have been able to achieve an industrialized civilization. And if we use up our coal reserves, our species, or future species will never be able to reindustrialize if something destroys our current civilization.

Or, they did not develop a social system based on greed.

They probably have more super geniuses also.

I used to live near refineries and had that same thought about the infrastructure, its so enormous its hard to see any company giving it up easily there has been and is so much invested in it to keep it operational. Sadly a lot of our own money subsidises it.

And we struggle to get past it.

true, it’s the cabal that holds us back

Got us where? A dying burning planet and finite expensive resources we kill ourselves with? Some oil-based generational wealth oligarchies and other billionaires? Seems like we veered way off course from something that is otherwise absurdly better in every way, if our neighborly "others" tech is anything to go by.

I had this same thought. It sort of felt like a way to humanize Grusch a bit, and for the public to get to know that he's not some crazy person.

Yeah, that's fair enough. I agree with Grusch at around 1:46:30 when he's (jokingly) saying this felt more like you educating me than me saying anything to your audience lmao. He just keeps going on and on about theories he believes and asking Grusch if he also believes them. The best parts of the interview were when Grusch was allowed to talk about why the DoD allowed him to speak about certain parts and the Energy Act stuff and wish they could've focused on something like that more rather than the interviewer just theory-dumping on us.

Very true! Also, human technology has been influenced by all of the circumstances and other life forms on Earth. Just another factor that could change how others would have developed technology. Maybe NHI that originate on similar planets around similar stars have similar tech and history to us, while NHI on completely different types develop completely differently in a way that we can't fathom. And maybe our ways are something THEY cannot even fathom. At that point, the more/less developed dichotomy becomes much less clear.

Later this week Uber skeptics: Grusch should know it’s wingardium leviosa not leviosaaah

Thank you for this, I'm watching it now. 👍

Wow. Pretty crazy stuff. What a wild time to me alive

Just finished the video, here's my take on it. David Grusch is one of us. He wasn't when his journey began but what he learned along the way by talking to people inside the government that he knew and trusted, often as friends, convinced him that what he disclosed to Congress was true. The interview was a bunch of friends discussing their extremely well informed theories about life, the universe, UAPs, and everything. I don't do youtube videos but this two hours was well spent. I don't care what anyone says about David Grusch, he doesn't set my BS detector off even a little.

In this reality its more like a poop knife

Yes, they need to be investigated for that reason. These stories are definitely interesting.

“Ever seen a little show called “Ancient Aliens” pal? I’ve got over 18 seasons of evidence all right here.”

You new around these parts? Study up pal.

Ignorance is strong with this one. Congress just said UAPs are real, do try and keep up.

I like Reddit comments like this.

If we are separated by some dimensional barrier and we did combine forces… watch out anyone else. The combination of our primitive yet endlessly destructive weaponry being delivered by craft that have that kind of performance would be quite formidable.

I don't think you can have innerstellar travel without breaking the atom or at least knowing nuclear physics pretty well.

The medical torture and unlawful imprisonment of intelligent beings.

[deleted]

I just DM'd you.

That's why I think a lot of this has been kept secret. We still have a large dependency on certain religious concepts, processes and deities. People having their most cherished beliefs challenged or flat out stated as being incorrect might be psychologically damaging.

>cross breading Hmm, and what dipping sauce can we use for the breaded humans?

Possibly but it's likely that we'll never know for sure since it's classified.

I’d totally believe Zuck and Musk are hybrids

You cannot breed a cat and a dog…

Okay, that's a terrifying idea

Why would the government speculate on religion in relation to having physical evidence of UHI's. Serious question, I don't see the connection.

Don't know why this is being downvoted. This is the exact context that seems to be indicated at that point of the convo. He talks about how it would have been ontologically disruptive to your average American's world view who were largely non-secular at the time. Imagine if the government said, "hey so we found out there is a god who created the world but ... uh .. turns out it's the extra-dimensional alien equivalent of a teenager tinkering with a raspberry pi in their basement." Imagine if we had confirmation we are in a simulation -how would that effect people showing up to till the fields in the morning or go to work at the twinkie factory? Or essentially the government suddenly creating the world's newest religion.

I honestly don’t see how they would know that though, unless they asked the NHI personally. The thing that I could see happening is that they are future humans or some very similar looking race. Or that they share dna with us

I don't think so, from what I've read, every time we've fired on them or tried to, we've either had no impact on them or our equipment malfunctioned. Two US patrol boats reportedly fired on a UFO during the Viet Nam war, one boat was destroyed when its own fire was returned by the UFO, the other boat's fire didn't affect the UFO at all.

Bruh how u gonna throw demonic on there. Ffs ur tryna explain some spiritual perhaps advanced shit and then you throw a word that’s from when we were cavemen on the end of it

You have no way of knowing whether or not that's true.

That would be cool, in a scary way…

Totally different thing. We are related to a Banana, and all life on Earth, so it’s not surprising. If we are related to NHI then that’s a pretty big deal and raises a bunch of questions.

My ex shared DNA with both of them. That slut.

[deleted]

Ball soo hard....dee doo dee doo dee doo

After listening to the interview, I believe him even more. He explains his reasoning. I take back anything negative I have said about the man.

He literally cant tho, didnt you read about this shit before? Congress already.got the dates, names, locations.

> but I’m not going to share any answers because ~~that’s not my job~~ I would like to not go to prison This is also a consideration.

He's not asking you to believe him. He's asking for his claims to be investigated. Grow up. Nobody cares if you believe him or not.

I don’t think you or many of us know how the classification levels work is all. It is like the Coca Cola secret ingredients being secret. If we all just knew we all wouldn’t be making Coca Cola as good so we might as well not know. What I mean is that he knows he doesn’t know enough to make all the plot come together. And he doesn’t even know if anyone does but he can speculate that someone has enough information to make it all make sense. Also he doesn’t want to speculate because he doesn’t want to be wrong. The type of person that would be hired in his consulting role would have to have that mindset. Be judgmental but with the knowledge I know: and how can I make things better. I still believe him 100%. He is better at speaking his opinion and leading us to the next level than any politician ever. This is special.

lol so funny to me this is upvoted. you understand he’d be breaking his security clearance talking about this right? would you put out information that would land you in prison for decades? somehow i doubt it. so easy for us comfortable keyboard warriors to sit here without any skin in the game and shit on the very few people openly talking about this topic. and people seriously wonder why others privy to this info don’t come out and tell the public what they know.

The more he speaks the worse it gets. It was nearly adding a slight bit of credibility to his story when he went silent for over a month there. But when he comes on and starts coming out with random shit like “they went down a different tech tree”. If he had any actual evidence and he truly was a “patriot” he would have released it by now. People go on hunger strike and die in prison all the time for causes they believe in. Why does he get the to have credit of being a “patriot” and a “hero” without actually doing anything yet? He testified under oath that a bunch of other people told him stuff. So if it’s proven to be untrue, he’s still not going to prison because he can just claim he was lied to as well. He’s not stupid. He’s taken no risk here. Meanwhile he now’s got 1 million members on this Reddit forum that would sell their souls for him. He’ll be at all the UfO events giving talks, release book like coultart etc. “Why would he lie, what does he have to gain”…..what indeed…..

You may be right. Could also be to do with psychology. If you tell people everything all at once, it sounds fantastical. If you say, ‘hey maybe look over there’ you believe with your own eyes when you find it. However, the only evidence we have still, are the verified ATIP videos and he has made it all the way to the senate hearing, so there must be something there.

I’m with you, the numerous red flags that everyone loves to ignore, and the fact that he would have brought some type of evidence forward if there was any, and no he wouldn’t be arrested for revealing aliens have been here or are here, that’s something so big and life changing there’s no way they would put him in jail for that

A nub seeps out of his bum and everyone starts clawing toward him with their beady eyes and dripping wet lips, coming up with all sorts of hilarious theories. He is a questionable character with a spotty past at best. He has no first hand evidence, by his own admission. All his buddies with all their wild tales are giving him a platform, and he’ll be cashing in every time he drops a hint that he is **the** guy. More likely all figments of his imagination.

I guess two sides to this. Would you want to be the guy that possibly kills civilization by saying life after death doesn't matter, we're in a simulation etc. Aliens created us? These are dangerous words for sure and everyone will react differently so I'm sure he's been pondering this for a while.

No, I don't believe he is a grifter at all

That makes sense, thanks.

Seems so. Just an odd way to put it. *shrugs*

[removed]

What in the world are you talking about friend

Can’t tell if you’re just arrogant or if this is a really bad attempt at disinfo

Who is the "they" to which you're referring?

I’m nostalgic for a pre-internet world, so I get it. I would accept the internet cultural influence of 97-99.

Pre-Trump and Covid was pretty nice too

What, you don’t like being in the 22nd year of a perpetual war state thats *been renewed every year since 2001* and gives the government truly despotic authority over your constitutional rights to protect your from the boogeyman of “terrorism” despite the fact that we seldom hear about it anymore? Nostalgic? Yea, Ok boomer- Download TikTok and get with the program

i'd settle for a return to 2015

It could also make them double down on their faith. There are religions that describe entities that exist in between. As well as cryptic creatures and spirits.

They’ll incorporate it. I’d be willing to bet.

They don’t have to be mutually exclusive. NHI and a God/creator/etc can still exist together.

What about when that 16% present of the population that believes in nothing but a purposeless universe suddenly has to come to terms with a universe full of consciousness and intentionality unexplainable by a materialistic paradigm?

LOL. .Disclosure of beings from the "spiritual realm" (if that's what they end up being), who visit humanity and perform miracles by having the ability to appear and disappear while operating under an unknown source of energy would CONFIRM religious history (at least in the Bible.. not sure about others) and DEBUNK science which claims these things can't happen. The real question is, "what happens to science when its shown to be wholly inadequate to describe reality"?

I'm a non-religious person and I've managed to avoid running around killing people so I think we'll be ok. We might need to start mass counseling the 84%, though. If they found out there's no God, Jesus, Mohammed, etc., they would probably need a lot of hand holding for a while.

Going to church or calling yourself religious is not the same as having a moral compass

The existence of NHI doesn't mean God doesn't exist.

Huh? This would only make people more religious.

What I don’t get, is why people need a consequence in order to live morally? Don’t murder Or Else you go to hell. Ethics doesn’t need religion. If people want to be ethical, it’s their choice. Hopefully people realize they don’t need a religion to be moral.I’m sure it will be an odd day if we do make contact. I hope a peaceful one. The ones that can’t handle reality, not sure what to do with them.

We'll they haven't handled a fairly simple thing like coming out of COVID too well.

For me and many I follow this only strengthens our belief in God. It is the agnostics and atheists that will most likely have the biggest challenge with their new reality. A universe filled with beings traveling through space and time is no different than the beings in the bible who also traveled through space and time.

They did spend the last 10 minutes of the interview talking about the religious implications. They brought up the possibility of the worlds religions incorporating the NHI reality into their teachings… which seems like a far fetched possibility tbh

Imagine if aliens say God exists and we all should worship the creator Athiests will do mass suicide

The church will come out with some bullshit to keep everyone hooked don’t worry about that

I don't accept your number. We have never been less religious.

They will get to believe in something new called reality. Because what they have been worshiping their whole life is bullshit.

going off what religious people have said to me over the years, a non zero number of them are only abstaining from theft, rape, and murder because of their belief in their specific religion. I think we are safe though, at this point after everything we have been through, i think it's safe to say that no truth will shake people from their religion of choice. Wr've seen a lot of new information come over the years and even that hasn't broken their faith. I doubt anything ever will.

John Lennon has entered the chat...

This stuff is why people don't take people that think aliens are secretly visiting us seriously. They will very happily and quickly jump to any nonsense conspiracy.

It's far more fun to panic and make millions in clickbait videos.

Same I really won’t be surprised if they created us by splicing their DNA with apes. That could even be the baggage really when we realize we’re hybrids of them. Even if they didn’t create us they may be making hybrids now which we’ve found evidence of.

Wouldn't we be really smart apes though? I like to think their reaction is more like the "They're Made out of Meat!" short story.

I agree with this. My take is that aliens aren't invested in the human experience as much as some assume. analogous to my relationship with butterflies. I go about my day completely ignoring butterflies, but if by chance, I encounter one that is stuck, I might help it a little, but ultimately don't give a shit. Similarly, these guys landed to do something, some kids approached, and they were like "fyi, y'all are fucking this place up. Might want to think about quitting". And then go about their business not giving a shit

I was noticing this too. Why did he keep it on in the footage of them hiking outside you think? Did Grusch think the watch would be less visible in those shots, or...?

They'll didn't go anywhere. They existed in a parallel universe until they figured out how to cross over. Here's one of the defense contractors that is supposedly studying the NHI to explain it: https://now.northropgrumman.com/parallel-universe-theory-what-are-the-chances-of-another-you

It's pronounced "Cor-Nell" and its the highest rank in the Ivy League!

He said he would sit in a chair with the tightest shorts he could find with the camera set to "crotch shot" mode.

Here’s his Quora profile. He was a strategist at Google before moving to Thiel https://www.quora.com/profile/Jesse-Michels-1

Its so easy to say that. Here, I'll show you. I, too, talked to the DoD and requested their permission to publish definitive disputation of all of this and they refused.

Well, big supporter of Grusch here, but Snowden did it

I can't be curious but also demand evidence before taking a truly earth shattering claim seriously? Good to know you think this sub should be a cult.

Stop using your brain and just believe everything!

[removed]

LMAO that's now salesmen work, sport.

The guy said it's not his job the share the more important details which implies even if he could share or can share them he wouldn't. That's a very different stance than saying - I can't share these details without breaking the law. I 100% have defended Grusch for not wanting to go to jail for leaking classified information. I get that and respect his decisions. But again that is not what he is saying here at all.

Theres zero chance he got "clearance" to talk about the US having actual alien bodies in their possession but then cant talk about other things because he would sent to jail how you guys fail to recognize this glaring conflict is beyond me

yeah theres ZERO chance they allowed him to say the government hides alien bodies but he isnt allowed to say where. this makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. you must really cope hard to not see any conflict here. you probably also find it totally plausible that bob lazar has stable element 115 buried somewhere and could end the whole discussion right now but dont show it because "reasons". totally legit this fella right? or what about knapp who was in possession of a video tape that had proof of element 115 and its anti gravity characteristics, but then re recorded the evidence with an episode of the golden girls. yeah my dog ate my homework haha, happens... why should i leave the sub? im interested in the uap / ufo topic. i know it sounds weird but theres a middle spectrum between "theres no chance of aliens and everything is a bird" and "hail to everyone pro ufo, us against everyone else."

imo its only because elizondo has too much controversy and grusch officially was part of the ufo taskforce besides this, they are pretty much the same massive claims, no evidence and a lot of spot light searching

For real. People talk about someone else being a hero, but sometimes it just sucks

Snowden did nothing wrong

Snowden talked about different green men who committed crimes. Not aliens.

Chelsea Manning got her sentence commuted. Reality Winner served her time and is out. Interesting that the active military people were willing to face the law for what they believe to be in the American people's interest yet Snowden and Assange claim it's all about sending them to a black site never to be heard from again. So there is a threshold that people are willing to breach the law and reveal things for the benefit of the American public and face the legal consequences. What does US troops killing civilians in Afghanistan and the (then) administration minimizing the active efforts Russia put in to sway the 2016 election, if those rise to the level of breaching the law to make public but a conspiracy to hide NHI's doesn't in 80 years, then it really seem credulous to think there is some meat behind that particular claim.

I concur. UAP daddy 😍

I was in the Army man, the government is a bloated bureaucratic shit show with no ability to keep even the slightest state secrets. Not only from its people, but from foreign governments as well. Whatever foreign spies steal from us are even less able to keep state secrets from THEIR people.

Yea I'd never seen glare on an IR camera before, now we have proof that it exists. Waiting for the next blockbuster leaks.

Or you know, I know people who've lost family and money to grifters and cults, and it doesn't sit well with me when I see people making shit up and being evasive. You can veteran this and that from the outside, but when you've been to theater you see some of these veterans be less than morally upstanding. I don't have to reveal more than that. I want you to consider that there are grifters out there, they are attracted to these exact situations... not being able to be proven wrong, and fanatic fans that don't question someone leasing their credentials to feed their desires. Psychologically blocking what I'm saying so you can keep imagining aliens saving us with high tech civilization any day now, or whatever, doesn't help people who end up wasting serious time and money on this. Hobby? sure. I've watched many hours of UFO disclosure, pyramids this and that. But allergic reactions to skepticism? seriously? I would love nothing more than for us to be part of a bigger universe populated by aliens that come here all the time. But if I don't say something here, I don't sit right with myself. So I've said my peace and yea, if I created some doubt, I've done what I feel is my duty in this situation. Communities with no doubt and don't question people who come with some authority are dangerous to themselves and others. Do you not doubt the official line? then you're in the same boat. Are you also "hiding behind anonymity and a keyboard" because you have an account here and don't want people harassing you for some opinion? Stop being a politician and playing kindergarten word games, you might actually benefit, agree or not.

It's because a lot of people browse https://www.reddit.com/r/all/, and that will show results from almost all subreddits as long as they got popular enough. Posts like this make it to /r/all , so you get random people who have a passing interest in this(like me) clicking on posts like this, but think Grusch is probably full of shit and will keep believing that until we see some actual evidence. I keep checking in from time to time because it is interesting, but so far all i've seen is a lot of hot air. I mean sure, there's something there with the lack of congressional oversight into a military program but it's a giant leap to go from "Someone in the government is hiding something without oversight that should be there!" to "It's actually aliens!" also if people started going crazy believing in bigfoot or ghosts, and posts started making it to /r/all about it, i'd absolutely comment on it going "Cool, show me the evidence". Because to be quite honest, I WANT something weird and unexpected to turn out to be true. It'd be crazy if ghosts were real, or if bigfoot actually did exist! Worldview changing for ghosts. Just show me the evidence.

bigfoot isnt discussed in front of senate, accompanied by some ex government paid people claiming they have it all figured out because "trust me bro". thats a big difference

[removed]

Or maybe they are open minded to some of it, but don’t believe the more woo side and find the wild speculations being presented as fact silly and reductive.

[removed]

That is what bothered me too. It's one thing if you can't say things because it's classified. I 100% respect not wanting to go to jail or be snowden'ed- I have defended him countless times on this sub from the people who say put up or shut up. But this whole "it's not my job" implies he either can say more and is not - or at the very least even if I could say more, I wouldn't which is VERY different than I can't say this because it's classified. He has already vaguely talked about highly controversial subjects from bioligics, the Vatican, craft retrieval, and dark programs... he already went public, he is already out there and dealt with all the bullshit. I just don't understand this. If it was so important the public knows how can you NOT share the details to move us closer. Again if it's classified fine, but that's not what he's saying here.

What’s shocking is all these people “who came forward” showed up with zero actual evidence. What an odd coincidence. The government can’t stop people from coming forward on a daily basis, but can somehow keep all the actual proof 100% hidden, despite all those trying to blow the whistle.

Agreed. Someone just got sentenced to 30 years to life off of witness testimony

Literally thousands of people saying similar things. Some people won’t be satisfied until a UFO is carted onto the White House lawn. Hell some people still don’t believe Covid is real. 🤷‍♂️

Electric chair? Maybe in your 3rd world country.

It's just planned obsolescence

Whistleblowers should stop making public appearances without actually sharing the information they claim is risking their life. A whistleblower's duty is to submit the evidence in the proper channels and stay hidden IF they are truly in danger. Not showboat with kids in Youtube videos.

Yuuuuup. I’m in an argument in two different comment sections with the same guy saying the same dumb things and I don’t think he realizes it. Can’t wait till he does. I think I’ll be trolling the trolls today. Good times. Edit: ooh he found out. He’s so mad I can hear him stomping his feet from here. 😂

By making his identity public but not the information, he makes himself a target. Now if anything of substance leaks, he will take the blame. If I had friends, family, loved ones of any kind, or any type of self preservation drive, I wouldn't be doing what Grusch is doing. Here's the thing... I'm plenty open minded and I believe there are tons of legit UFO secrets that deserve to be liberated. But whatever they are, they're not what Grusch is on about. He's like a guy selling maps instead of taking us to the treasure himself.

You stay anonymous to protect yourself. Going public with his identity and making himself a celebrity is why he "can't" simply release the documents himself, resulting in an endless tease. If he stayed anonymous, he could protect himself while also bringing knowledge to the public. Instead all we have is another guy on TV making promises with nothing material to back it up.

If he's willing to sit back and wait for a bunch of bureaucrats and institutions (the same bureaucrats and institutions that made everything secret in the first place) to liberate the knowledge, he will be waiting forever. That to me says that there's nothing he knows about that he thinks is particularly revelatory or mind blowing. He is fine with letting it sit in a vault forever while humanity stays ignorant.

Actually I think that argument is quite reasonable. If aliens were confirmed as real and visiting the planet regularly, maybe since the dawn of time, do you think everybody will just go to work the next day like nothing has changed? I think there would be definite disruption to a lot of things, although how long it would last is hard to say.

I actually don’t think we’ve had any direct comments from this Inspector General, just that he verified David Grusch’s whistleblower claims. There could definitely be some nuance in the wording at play here. Dunno, just feels like people are quick to dismiss these very official and high ranking military officers with a hand wave?

Lol well I guess I can’t rule that out, I’m just praying that not everybody involved is crazy and delusional. Especially not the people who can fire the nukes 🤣

Thanks for clarifying. I mean yeah I can’t dispute your point really, he’s either lying or he isn’t. I would still like some proper investigation to be done before everybody writes him off as a con-man. I’m giving him the benefit of the doubt for now, so let’s see where it goes. If in 12 months we still haven’t seen anything to corroborate his story then I’ll be happy to hate on Dave too. Not sure I buy the ‘make bank off the media circus’ angle seeing as he torpedo’d the good salary he had from working in the MIC, but I have no idea what he makes now or back then, so maybe?

The majority of people in power jumping on this seriously are all right wing. The same group that has gone off the deep end with conspiracies, rhetoric and using anything people will believe to get the vote. Not very reassuring.

Yeah but let's say the govt does have some sort of teleporting/free energy tech they've borrowed from the aliens... Don't you think that someone telling the world the govt has those things would be a significant breach of national security (given the advantage they would provide)? To some extent, revealing the US govt has a relationship with the aliens where tech transfer is a possibility would be a similar breach of national security (given the potential competitive advantage). The only way that these revelations wouldn't be major breaches of national security would be if they aren't true.

If you don't want to be misinterpreted you could have defined what you mean. And calling people low thinkers is more condescending than any of the responses to your comment.

You say assuming shit about you is low effort, yet you yourself assume people are “low thinkers” based on reddit comments, lmao.

That’s which is claimed absent evidence can be dismissed the same.

Do you literally think the government is a single monolithic entity where everyone thinks the same way? Do you even know what a whistleblower is?

He hasn't said much though, is what people keep saying.

Coulthart mentioned that the ICIG’s report is coming out soon and although I do have some criticisms of him, he does seem to know generally what’s going on involving Grusch, if for no other reason than the fact that him and Grusch are friends. Also, the ICIG’s investigation began back in 2021 so it should naturally be finished fairly soon. If the ICIG came out and said they found nothing, I would be very surprised, mainly because he’s the only reason Grusch was able to speak to Congress in the first place. When a whistleblower files a complaint with the ICIG, they have to assess the credibility of the complaint based on the evidence provided. If it is deemed to be credible, then the whistleblower is forwarded on to Congress. So it would be pretty weird if the ICIG found Grusch’s complaint credible at the time only to change his mind. We also shouldn’t forget that Grusch testified he had the first hand witnesses provide a protected disclosure to the ICIG as well. Also note that the original ICIG is Grusch’s personal lawyer, and his law firm normally only represents current government employees. So the fact that he’s still choosing to represent Grusch, even though his firm finished Grusch’s initial representation, suggests that the evidence Grusch and others possess must be pretty convincing. Regardless, if the ICIG says they found nothing to support Grusch’s allegations then all I’d do is wait until the disclosure bill is passed and the records are declassified. If nothing comes out, then I’d happily admit that I was wrong.

And now Edward Snowden can't enter the US ever again. Do you really expect this man to risk his entire life, family, and retirement so we can gain some information? He's doing this by the book which lends credibility. We've witnessed what happens to whistleblowers who've worked outside officially channels. The public writes them off because they have no supporting evidence.

And no one gave a fuck about what Ed Snowden did.

Every comment I see about "they should just give it all up" makes me wonder if the person commenting would willingly toss their lives and their family's life away to be locked in prison and never have freedom again for some "greater good". Edward Snowden leaked stuff, but did the world fundamentally change? Was there ontological shock? No. Grusch could spill the beans right now and people still wouldn't believe it, even if he got arrested. The safest and smartest way to proceed is legally through proper channels and legal processes, eventually leading to **official** government disclosure.

Yet another poster who has absolutely no idea how national security actually works.

Yes agreed I’m not sure why many people seem to forget this

If anything Snowden is a cautionary tale that the people would not give a single speck of a shit and he'd ruin his and his family's lives for nothing. These "ex" CIA types spearheading disclosure are also smart enough to know that if they spilled the beans on EVERYTHING, the CIA's crimes and lies to humanity would inevitably be exposed and their reputation would be basically permanently tarnished. It'd sour the US's image as a whole in the world stage as well. A single nation violently keeping world-changing tech for themselves rather using it to better humanity as a whole? Can you imagine global outrage? And the political ammunition it would provide to the US's adversaries? That's what these goobers mean when they keep chanting "muh national security". They are still very much "patriots" and would rather not jeopardize their country in such a way.

Duh, you really don't understand how secret clearances work? Really?

Yes, because I'm sure you too would give up your life and freedom on a whim for the "greater good". Please get a grip on reality, this is not a blockbuster movie.

Lol, you first. Show us all how you aren't a coward.

Arrested? They would ‘accidentally’ get a bullet in their head, staged as a suicide or something like that.

Nono you see all those actual whistleblowers like Snowden were just dummies, in order to bring about change, you only 'whistleblow' to the people covering malfeasance up in the first place. You also make sure absolutely NO ONE in the public has access to the information you'd need to prove any of your claims because...uh...security clearances, or something! I mean we pardon and forgive foreign spies, give them cash and prizes for their time, and send them home, but the person that reveals the answer to one of the most profound and asked questions in human history? Obviously they'd totally get the book thrown at them, and no one would blink an eye!

And yet 84% of adults are religious, according to the 5 second Google I just did

If this is true why isn't he dead already. He let the secret out, if you believe him? You don't think that information was classified?

I like how y'all think the details are classified but everything else isn't and that his life is in danger only if he releases those details but not prior to that when he's said all the shit he's already said.

I don't get your logic. You believe all that, but then turn around and believe something as ludicrous as the government having a 'process' for snitching on itself and revealing earth shattering levels of malfeasance?

You seem like a totally rational person

Just you wait until disclosure happens within the next 1 - 800 years. You'll have egg on your face then!

Okay cause they do to me too! I just wondered if that's because other neurodivergant people rarely appear "off" to me - thanks for your input :)

It doesn’t matter, seeing as they both back up his claims. Presumably, they don’t think a former military officer suffering from PTSD is as big a deal as you do.

If you mean me, then I’m doing my best. I have no problem with skeptics. But when toxic trolls from r/all brigade the sub I feel I have a responsibility to push back.

Yes, his public testimony. I highly doubt you watched his private testimony to the SSCI and to the ICIG. Also, how is he changing his tune? You do realise that bodies are biologics, right? He was asked, do we have the bodies of the pilots in the hearing, and he said yes.

[deleted]

Yeah man, I can't drop military acronyms like you. "I was PCS'd to the 509th bomb wing living in their TLFs. Ate at the BK in the BX. Audited their nuclear vehicles for the NWCSSC. Got a tour of the B2 from an ayyayy". Most of these posts might be 'tarded but this year's NDAA Includes a UAP Disclosure Amendment including 20+ references to non-human intelligence. This was introduced by the Senate Majority Leader with White House support. You think they wrote this just for shits and grins?

What book are you talking about? I can't find it. He likely did the interview for free since he's known Jesse for a couple years. If you can claim he 100% did get paid, can you provide the source? As Ross Coulthart has said, journalists don't pay for interviews because that compromises the story. I don't even know if you're talking about Grusch or Fravor at this point. You mention both in your original post but you seem to think I can pick up who you're talking about. These grifter claims are weak and shows a lack of critical thinking skills by many.

Where is the book? What the actual fuck are you talking about? Where is the evidence he was paid for anything? You're just completely and utterly full of shit.

**First rule of investigative club:** Know the rules of the game and know them exhaustively.

I don't know if that makes me believe him more or less. The only person who I believe 100% in all of this is David Fravor.

I mean it certainly implies that they think it’s a very strong likelihood. They mention “non-human intelligence” more than 20 times and include extensive legalistic mechanisms throughout the 64 pages.

You seem to be highlighting the word may without understanding the context of may in that clause. The may is not saying it may exist. The may is saying a human or legal entity may have recovered it and is controlling it. The other person should still submit their case, but this clause isn't supporting your point. It is, in fact, defining the government's stated rights when NHI technology is collected on our turf regardless of what legal entity did the collecting.

It specifically says “nonhuman intelligence, *of which the Federal government has become aware.*”

Because it would gain him nothing while revealing a great deal about what he knows, with whom he works, and to what extent (if any) he's broken various career-related mandates in order to uphold those of his conscience. Also because the whole deal with intelligence is knowledge = power. Why would you give your adversaries power if you don't need to? It seems like he's been really careful to only provide the minimum possible public information required to keep disclosure moving along. The dude isn't an idiot.

I think it would look bad on him to reveal he had a hand in the legislation. It certainly doesn't look bad to me, and would even lend more credibility to everything he says in my eyes. But there are people out there who would use that to try to blow the whole thing off after he mentions Schumer taking it seriously and drafting the legislation. "I had a hand in it" to skeptics = "I manipulated these people into creating legislation around things I made up." That's just how many would look at this, the way they were trying to imply that because he met Corbell at a Star Trek convention, and because Corbell and Knapp were behind him at the hearing, this somehow means he was infiltrated by these UFO groups and was manipulated by them into believing things. I know this isn't true. I'm simply saying this is how the skeptic mind works when grasping for any reason to call him a liar. It's the type of "scandal" people like Greenstreet have built their careers on.

Nah. I still examine every piece of data on what it is.

Or simply that if you invested in this clown show, that bar may be lower than you believe XD

I don't think he’s particularly intelligent and I wonder about his mental health. He seems very manic at times. He's also keeping company with the UFO entertainment industrial complex. Delonge, Puthoff, Elizondo, Kean, the Skinwalkers and the menagerie of magical thinkers.

The fact that people are eating this up is embarrassing. Edit: you can downvote me all you want. It's not going to make you any less gullible for believing this dude. There's a reason there's been NO actual evidence. The same reason there won't be any moving forward. Either he's being lied to by several individuals or he's lying himself. Likely both. The more he says, the less believable he is. Hence, it's embarrassing to still believe him at this point.

> Where did the Senate declare that? When they passed their part of the NDAA that included the UAPDA which said that.

We get that this is all entertainment to you and you're upset because you didn't get to see what's behind the curtain, but put your personal feelings aside instead of pouting that the movie wasn't as exciting as you expected and kept you in suspense at the end. This isn't a movie, and he's provided the info he needs to provide to the IG, and legislation has obviously come about because of it. He's getting the ball rolling and he's ensuring he does it the right way so they don't use all these tactics up their sleeve to derail the whole thing. No image or document he uploads online is going to prove anything. We have AI now to make any images we want. There's nothing he can do other than go through the channels to get enough of a snowball going to cause the programs to be exposed, the government to go in with raids if necessary, and the government to then tell you the programs and crafts are real, which is something that is better than an image AI could have created.

Good thing he went to a House hearing then!

Autistic people have a strong need to have their expectations met. Sometimes this means that they follow rules And expect everyone to do the same. Other times it means they can lie to themselves to maintain their beliefs despite opposition, and then share their "truth" with others. There is a reason Borderline Personality Disorder has strong ties to autism + trauma. Autistic people are some of the best & worst people in the world, but they're still just people.

This is hosted on the "Democrat" side of the websites but was voted upon, approved and transmitted to the US House for NDAA 2024 inclusion: https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/uap_amendment.pdf Pages 2-3, right in front: Congress finds and declares the following: > Legislation is necessary because credible evidence and testimony indicates that Federal Government unidentified anomalous phenomena records exist that have not been declassified or subject to mandatory declassification review as set forth in Executive Order 13526 (50 U.S.C. 3161 note; relating to classified national security information) due in part to exemptions under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.), as well as an over-broad interpretation of ‘‘transclassified foreign nuclear information’’, which is also exempt from mandatory declassification, thereby preventing public disclosure under existing provisions of law. Page 5: > CONTROLLING AUTHORITY.—The term ‘‘controlling authority’’ means any Federal, State, or local government department, office, agency, committee, commission, commercial company, academic institution, or private sector entity in physical possession of technologies of unknown origin or biological evidence of non-human intelligence. Page 6: > LEGACY PROGRAM.—The term ‘‘legacy program’’ means all Federal, State, and local government, commercial industry, academic, and private sector endeavors to collect, exploit, or reverse engineer technologies of unknown origin or examine biological evidence of living or deceased non-human intelligence that pre-dates the date of the enactment of this Act. > NON-HUMAN INTELLIGENCE.—The term ‘‘non-human intelligence’’ means any sentient intelligent non-human lifeform regardless of nature or ultimate origin that may be presumed responsible for unidentified anomalous phenomena or of which the Federal Government has become aware. Page 8: > TECHNOLOGIES OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN.—The term ‘‘technologies of unknown origin’’ means any materials or meta-materials, ejecta, crash debris, mechanisms, machinery, equipment, assemblies or sub-assemblies, engineering models or processes, damaged or intact aerospace vehicles, and damaged or intact ocean-surface and undersea craft associated with unidentified anomalous phenomena or incorporating science and technology that lacks prosaic attribution or known means of human manufacture.

Page 30, here, this cited section, to me is batshit insane because it precludes the use of the Filibuster and *commands* both the President and Senate to keep nominating and voting *quickly* whenever all positions are not filled. The Senate and the President -- remember, the National Security Council both support the UAPDA -- are handcuffing themselves. This is not "may" language. It's compelled action. That does not happen. Pages 32-33: > QUALIFICATIONS.—Persons nominated to the Review Board—> > (A) shall be impartial citizens, none of whom shall have had any previous or current involvement with any legacy program or controlling authority relating to the collection, exploitation, or reverse engineering of technologies of unknown origin or the examination of biological evidence of living or deceased non-human intelligence; > > (B) shall be distinguished persons of high national professional reputation in their respective fields who are capable of exercising the independent and objective judgment necessary to the fulfillment of their role in ensuring and facilitating the review, transmission to the public, and public disclosure of records related to the government’s understanding of, and activities associated with unidentified anomalous phenomena, technologies of unknown origin, and non-human intelligence and who possess an appreciation of the value of such material to the public, scholars, and government; and > > (C) shall include at least— > > * (i) 1 current or former national security official;> * (ii) 1 current or former foreign service official;> * (iii) 1 scientist or engineer;> * (iv) 1 economist;> * (v) 1 professional historian; and > * vi) 1 sociologist. This compels the President to nominate people with exceptionally narrow widespread recognized expertise in those explicit fields. Why an economist, historian and sociologist if it's all bullshit? Further of the Senate binding itself on Page 34: > HOLDING HEARINGS.—Unless the Senate designates a different committee of jurisdiction, the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate shall hold confirmation hearings, and do so within 30 days after the first date in which the Senate is in session after the nomination of a minimum of 3 individuals for appointment to the Review Board, including the Executive Director established under section ll08(a). > > COMMITTEE VOTING.—Unless the Senate designates a different committee of jurisdiction, the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate shall vote on the nominations, and do so within 14 days after the first date on which the Senate is in session after the confirmation hearings, and shall report its results to the full Senate immediately. > > SENATE VOTING.—The Senate shall vote on each nominee to confirm or reject within 14 days after the first date on which the Senate is in session after reported by the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs or by a different committee as determined by the Senate.> > VACANCY.—A vacancy on the Review Board shall be filled in the same manner as specified for original appointment within 30 days of the occurrence of the vacancy.> The Senate is binding itself to an *absolute* timeline here. It even makes it damned impossible to leave the Review Board understaffed. The US Senate by law has effectively removed all politics from the process outside of straight voting in the Committee and general body. Pages 49-50: > CONTROLLED DISCLOSURE CAMPAIGN PLAN.—With respect to unidentified anomalous phenomena records, particular information in unidentified anomalous phenomena records, recovered technologies of unknown origin, and biological evidence for non-human intelligence the public disclosure of which is postponed pursuant to section ll06, or for which only substitutions or summaries have been 4 disclosed to the public, the Review Board shall create and transmit to the President and to the Archivist a Controlled Disclosure Campaign Plan, with classified appendix, containing— Then it goes on to spell out how the "controlled disclosure plan," which is MANDATORY under law, will be transmitted and executed. What are we disclosing if it's not real? And here's the especially crazy part... the largest expansion of Eminent Domain in the history of the United States of America. Pages 57-58: > EXERCISE OF EMINENT DOMAIN.—The Federal Government shall exercise eminent domain over any and all recovered technologies of unknown origin and biological evidence of non-human intelligence that may be controlled by private persons or entities in the interests of the public good. It even goes on to spell out how the Review Board can overpower even *Grand Jury* and similar ultra high-level legal lock outs to get at the data they want to get at. This is literally given the Executive Branch via Congress a degree of supremacy over the Judicial in this extremely narrow lane. Page 61 has my favorite "curious" bit, where it flat out says the UAPDA has precedence over literally any other law, full stop, the end. Why would all this be here, if it wasn't true, and why would the Senate declare, full stop, page 2, that this is happening if it is not?

So they fooled the whole Senate?

And it should ignite the deepest, most fundamental rage anyone has ever felt, because think of all of the human suffering that could have been prevented.

It's no secret that we have the technology to get rid of poverty and world hunger. We can feed the world and give everyone access to fresh drinking water and other basic necessities for a while now. But we don't. There is greed, corruption and a lust for money and power. These are the things that are holding us back since the dawn of humanity. And because we know we *can* do it for the greater good, it's just extra damning that we *don't*. And I use the term 'we' in the most liberal sense here because most people (you, me and 90% of the rest of the world's population) can't do diddly squat about the status quo directly. Our abilities to do so are curtailed to only favor the current and local power structure. Real change has historically either come from revolution or from the inside out.

Yeah, it will never happen. Would be fucking awesome if it did, though.

The rise of protectionist nationalist movements comes from a fear of this exact kind of globalisation, it’s impossible to get human beings to sign up to because we (understandably) don’t trust centralisation of power to this extent.

Everything sounded good until you mentioned redistribution of wealth. That is never going to happen. Even with my little bit of wealth, I will defend it with my life. You will NEVER redistribute my little wealth I've managed to accumulate. As for my neighbor, you can have his.

> And every billionaire would be allowed 1 single billion, with the rest being redistributed to this project. There is this prevailing idea that people seem to have that billionaires have all these billions just sitting in their checking or savings account at the bank. It's not how the wealth of most billionaires is calculated. For example, their wealth could be based on the worth of the stock they hold of the companies they own. Or maybe it's other things, which are even less liquid. How are you going to distribute that? It's a ridiculous idea that (socialist) Reddit just doesn't seem to get.

The fuck? How exact do you not invest in humanity?

According to the latest Grusch interview that is exactly why a bunch of people are coming forward.

Some are greedy. Not everyone. So it doesn't apply to humans in general. What we need to do is find a way to rein in the greedy bastards while allowing humanity as a whole to flourish.

Their missionaries show up here all the time. Most who are even remotely interested in the woo aspect usually come across that sooner or later. In the latest Gruch interview he doesn’t get into what his beliefs are now, but he definitely has more of a spiritual leaning from agnostic, granted his breath work was for his autism, but it can act as a form of meditation. They don’t bring up the law of one, but do discuss the idea of people's energy, and love. It’s all very surface level, but you can apply the law of one with a lot of what they theorize about.

Always have been. There are cultures around the world that have traditionally accepted a 3rd gender, or have a completely different concept of gender identity than we and western people.

It has to do with resources and the control over them. In a post-scarcity society that issue ends.

>We spend all our time and energy, **as a planet**

mmmmm. Tea, Earl Grey....Hot. at the tip of my finger tips 🤤

I agree. They say it's a matter of WHEN, but we are heading to a much more racially homogeneous species. With effects like climate change forcing communities closer, it will speed it up. I'm not saying decades, or even, centuries, but I firmly believe it will happen EVENTUALLY...if we don't Epstein ourselves, and I mean that in all the ways it can be implied.

I'm dumb, sorry. Are you saying that because of threats like the USSR we need military spending? With that I agree, However, I'm going off the presumption this would A) be post-fossil fuel. That's what we are all fighting over. Land for resources and the power to control them. and B) that the US would just mind its business for once and stay out of the Eastern hemisphere militarily.

I think that we can defend ourselves for a fraction of a fraction of what we currently spend. We would need to stop projecting strength.

Unless we somehow discover a new element/material that would take us million years ahead technologically. I mean its not far fetched, all it took wa the industrial revolution and we went from using horses to flying in the air in a span of 70 years

This is assuming that the path we took is the only way to get there. The literal guy in the video talks about an alternate tech tree which could be entirely possible.

This hurt me.

>And if we use up our coal reserves, Or I mean, we could always just - I don't know - use the free energy literally falling from the sky every single minute of every single day.

>And if we use up our coal reserves, our species, or future species will never be able to reindustrialize if something destroys our current civilization. Is that necessarily a *bad* thing? Then the civilization that succeeds us does the same things wrong. Coal and oil have industrialized our nations but they've led to massive problems to our ecosystems. There has to be another way for civilizations to progress.

Industrialization is causing a mass extinction and could permanently disrupt Earth’s stable climate and biogeochemical state.

Among habitable worlds containing life, would it be unusual to have fossil fuels like earth has? A species on a planet like ours but without fossil fuels would be forced to go in an exclusively nuclear/ physics direction from the start.

It’s even worse than that, deforestation, indoor air pollution, and poverty in many places is caused because people aren’t using coal, and are instead still relying on wood as their primary energy source. Ironically to improve the environment/quality of life in these places we need to get them on fossil fuels asap, so they can use energy at a greater/more efficient scale than their current use and drive their own development. The rest of us need to put our efforts into transitioning away from these energy sources into whatever comes next on the ladder.

Just give it 70 million years pal. We will be coal one day.

Coal powered spaceships can be a thing, we don’t know for sure that they aren’t.

Our supply of coal is basically unlimited, 350+ years until we run out in the US.

We can always start whaling again

Thats why I believe the US tries to stop oil,gas, and coal extraction, there are people that want the rest of the world to use up all their supply, then the US will still have a lot left they can use when that time comes.

Coal is irrelevant if you live with Star Trek tech

Not necessarily. Nuclear energy could supply the world with energy if local governances would allow for it.

This assumes that coal would not be created in a cataclysm. We can't pretend to understand the dynamics of molecular reorganization during a nova event.

Arguable. I think we could have gone pretty far with wood pellets and alcohol if coal deposits didn't exist

Not necessarily true. It was definitely a boon, but we would have eventually got there through non-fossil fuel oil, natural gas, etc., that would have held us over until we mastered natural electricity sources and nuclear power. It may have taken an extra hundred or so years, there’s really no way to know, but it would have happened sooner or later.

Greed, often perceived as a uniquely human flaw, is also witnessed among our primate cousins, suggesting evolutionary roots. For instance, chimpanzees, observed by the likes of Dr. Jane Goodall, can be territorial and possessive over resources. This behavior, from an evolutionary lens, makes sense: hoarding can be a survival strategy. Furthermore, our brain's reward centers are tantalized by material acquisition, highlighting a neurological underpinning to greed. Yet, if we imagine extraterrestrial societies, two paths emerge: 1. Perhaps they evolved in environments where cooperation trumped competition. Just as Earth's ants and bees exemplify collective harmony, aliens might naturally prioritize the group over the individual. 2. Strong societal values emphasizing collective welfare could diminish greed. Earthly examples include the Aka hunters of Central Africa, who venerate sharing. Similarly, many human religions and philosophies, from Christianity to Buddhism, champion contentment and community. It's conceivable that alien belief systems would similarly temper materialistic urges.

There are hundreds of Cartels in every phase of the Economic and Industrial world (even Religion since we're opening the aperature here) that hold back a plethora of humanity's progress. All in the name of the almighty Dollar, maintaining the status quo, superiority, and global control of humakind of course. The big game. Don't worry it will change. Likely the Earth herself may cause it. The journey and the universe is more resilient and grand than the doom-sayers realize.

I'd argue those that fight tooth and nail against nuclear energy are holding us back

Lmaooo I forgot he said that to the interviewer. But yea you’re right, a good interviewer lets the story come out

Absolutely. It's frustrating how narrow people's imaginations are when thinking about what other beings could be like. Like people assume their computers are just more advanced than ours, but their computers, if they even have an equivalent, are almost certainly built upon a totally different framework than ours, something that isn't ones and zeros. And their cognitive structures and interpretations of sensory data could be completely different as well. They would be based on whatever worked best to navigate the conditions that were present when life first emerged on their world. I think you're totally right that because the divergence could be so great, that it would be very difficult to compare one to the other due to the limits of our objectivity.

What’s the “U” in “UAP” stand for again?

and we all know uap stands for alien spacecraft, right? right?

No one is disputing that UAP's are real.

This is the whole problem though don’t you see. We couldn’t have interstellar travel without breaking the atom. Because that’s how we have developed technologically it’s the source that would provide us the most energy. What if another life source developed different elements or had them available and were able to travel using means we have no idea exist. Splitting the atom is completely irrelevant if their entire tech tree has grown differently

I can't open it at work, but if the short story being referenced is the one I am thinking of. Then the whole idea is that most other intelligent races discover gravity manipulation technology around the time they discover electricity. This made space travel trivial for them causing their tech in other fields to stagnate as they focused on expansion and made resource scarcity not an issue. For whatever reason we missed a breakthrough on gravity manipulation which pushed us to develop extremely advanced tech in the fields of rocketry, nuclear physics, computing, etc compared to them.

Maybe they didn’t come from outside of our Earth, not interstellar, but inter dimensional 🤷🏻‍♂️

I’m pretty sure they do the same to us

Normal people have the “emotional energy” to care about more than one thing at a time

what's with the secrecy fam

If cross breaded humans taste like long pig, I would recommend katsu sauce.

You cannot fly into the water at the same speed you fly into air but seemingly these things do it. At some point you need to step away from the science we "know" to take in the science we don't. You need to remove the word "cannot" from your vocabulary here when discussing this topic.

But you could smash their DNA together in a lab and create a chimera..

Well, if you've ever interacted with a cornish rex cat you'd maybe wonder. They are the most dog-like cats I've ever encountered.

Lol we talking bout potential Aliens able to travel through space. Who knows what they could do

If they suspect that the beings made any contact in our ancient past, a radical re-examination of all our mythology is called for.

Because, I'm guessing, since it's been basically outlined like this for millennia in all types of religious texts. Am I about to be told what I just said is inaccurate? All of that shit ties in, no? I thought we all were basically on the same page now regarding that?

Yep. He pretty much straight up said the ontological shock will be in reference to what happens after death and realizing that we are not alone, and one of the original reasons for the secrecy was because of the religious world views at the time.

Maybe, Greys and Nordic are spiritual and reptilians are demonic? If there’s room for one, There’s room for both.

So… it’s perfectly rational to believe in spiritual or otherdimensional beings, but as soon as you apply the label of ‘demon’ you’re a nut? Do I understand this right?

He does. He is one

I didn’t say it was. It’s just a theory that I happen to hold to. You don’t have to agree.

Read Genesis 6 and the book of Enoch.

Maybe it’s as simple as we have cousins who live underwater.

Forgive my ignorance but wouldn't the building blocks of life result in similar DNA across multiple worlds?

Je would literally go down as the most influential man in history to expose an answer to one of the most asked questions in science "Are we alone?" Prison means nothing in this case if I was that guy. And I'm sure the public would fight for him too!

The secret ingredient was literally in the name!

Yes, they're all tough cookies willing to risk life and limb and life in prison from their comfortable chairs at home typing on their keyboards. LOL

>People go on hunger strike and die in prison all the time for causes they believe in. Why does he get the to have credit of being a “patriot” and a “hero” without actually doing anything yet? Would you risk your life and potentially the lives of your family?

For me it’s the new age bullshit that gets me When you start to mix up scientific based research with pseudo religious BS is when you cross the line

You've just got to walk down a few streets in the US to hear the crazies saying such things

You are such a tough armchair warrior.

Giving people vague unverifiable information isn't better than just giving actual details if you want to convince people. Currently the only evidence people have for any of this is downvotes when you ask for it.

That just means he caught you in the grift.

For sure, it's an odd turn of phrase

[removed]

Let him go. He’s rolling.

You’re missing a very important third possibility there

"I know the truth about UFOs/Aliens/Non-human biologics but I can't give you the whole picture because (reason)."

Not to mention pre-cell phone world. Feels like I'm living on a different planet compared to back then.

It really all did kinda start going downhill from here didn't it. Ubiquitous mobile phones, internet on mobile phones, social media

Oh dude, same. Early Internet was a little like the wild west, nowadays it's like Bladerunner with even more ads

if we're allowed to just choose, i'd like an order of 1960s culture with 2050s human rights.

How is the existence of whatever Grusch is talking about evidence for atheism?

Many will feel the need to spread the message, they are after all, "God's creatures" and need to be saved.

Yes. The Roman Catholic Church wisely never proclaimed against evolution/natural selection, and entirely incorporated it into its worldview (similarly for priest-discovered Big Bang — it was the atheists [who insisted against scientific evidence] that a steady state universe existed). Hinduism also incorporates both evolution and space science into its cosmology, and both religions “backengineer”/retrofit interpretations of their own religious texts to account for this.

For all we know NHI is the creator

thatd be awesome, what do you mean? proof is what i was waiting for all my life

My money's on the afterlife. What if we found out that it's possible to communicate with our loved ones who have passed on? What if 'passed on' just means living in another dimension?

How does NHI mean there's no God?

Me too. I'm athiest and have never once indulged in cannibalism or human sacrifice.

I agree, a large proportion of evangelical christians have a very skewed moral compass.

The amount of mental gymnastics that Christians do to maintain their faith is *astounding*.

Catholic theologians (I believe the Vatican astronomer specifically a few years ago?) have already put forward the idea that non-human intelligent beings from other worlds would be welcome in the church and could be baptized. More importantly, just about **every** world religion has non-human intelligent entities as a *fundamental part of their doctrine*. Religions explicitly have been founded to spread knowledge about the reality of a non-human intelligence. It's unlikely that major religions would incorporate or interpret real, tangible NHI in the same way as each other, but I think it's possible that the folks that'll have the hardest time ontologically with it would be hardline skeptics and adamant atheists.

Imagine the opposite. They come down and say Jesus and Mohammed were invented stories to keep peace in a time that lacked a rules based society.

"Sir, we snuck a few of our own apes into their forests as a test - the biggest, dumbest apes we had back home. No sir, no - they still haven't found any. Just the droppings and some footprints".

Aren’t humans just really smart apes? (Except for when they’re dumb)

could be a few different reasons, such as he wasn’t concerned about the location of the hike but was concerned about the location of the sit down

This one makes the most sense to me in regards to some abductee experiences of having two realities overlayed with each other. One possible thread to pull.

One day we’ll all laugh about this in Comstock Hall

Hahaaaaa

Thanks for this! Good to know!

Yeah true I guess 😅 although I’m going to assume that the UFO stuff is kept in a more secure facility then where they do all the hacking and spying. Now I’m interested to know how Snowden did it, will have to check that out tonight!

Uhhhh? Then be skeptical like everyone else should be? The fuck ahahaha

Nobody is saying that man, chill out. The problem is that me, you, and even Dave Grusch, don’t really have access to the evidence right now. I would love to see something more concrete but don’t expect anyone to walk into these facilities and sneak a selfie, the same way I’ve never seen inside a bomb making facility or Chinese submarine bases - these things are very well locked down. I appreciate the skepticism but there is clearly stuff going on behind the scenes with the NDAA 2024 and other whistleblowers, so let’s see what happens before slinging mud.

[removed]

Not great at detecting sarcasm eh? LMAO indeed.

They fail to recognized because Grusch is just saying what they already believe, he's preaching to the choir and that is the intention

Zero chance based on what evidence? You can stick that in front of anything, doesn’t make it true, it’s your opinion. You’ve also proven to be uninformed so why should that mean anything to me? The fact is he was cleared to speak on the matter before hand, your disbelief makes no difference. How come we’re allowed to know the US military has classified operations and technology, but we aren’t allowed to know the specifics of exactly what where and when? Same concept, Grusch can broadly say it’s happening without actually getting into the specifics. You can argue it actually makes sense because this doesn’t reveal the location, technology being used in the programs etc. You’ve added in a bunch of things about Bob Lazar that I haven’t said and isn’t even what we’re talking about. I don’t believe Bob Lazar, too many inconsistencies, now what? I know the type of middle ground that you’re talking about, it’s not people who go around making comments like “score points with believers”. They simply say there’s something here and I need better evidence. They’re usually pretty respectful, unlike you who hasn’t actually said anything but ad-hominem for the substance of your post.

They’re nor even remotely the same thing. You’re talking about someone who leaked an opposing nation interfering in our elections with our OWN nation with assistance from our OWN allies and our OWN telecommunication companies committing global surveillance. And then you’re trying to compare any of that to the government conspiring to and committing murder in the name of secrecy, withholding life altering technology to every nation on earth so we can continue to suffer and be slaves to a broken system, bullying smaller nations out of this technology, and withholding concrete evidence that we are not alone as an intelligent species. Nah fam nice try. Do not pass go, do not collect 200 dollars.

You say that, but would we ever have found out about a programme such as MK ULTRA if some of the only remaining files hadn’t been found by pure chance in a deceased officers belongings? And that programme was outlandish nobody thought it was true, but later confirmed to be real by a huge investigation. When things needs to be kept top secret, they stay that way. At least as far as the publics concerned anyway.

Oh so youve been a puppeteered gun and now you Know everything 🤔 Id tend to doubt that heavily.

I stopped reading after the first sentence about “grifters” and “cults”. Good day

When you have 40 different, credible people *with the appropriate access* tell you that, “Yeah, it *actually* **is** aliens…” it’s not really a “giant leap” anymore. You’re simply not wanting to accept the new reality so you tell yourself “nah, it’s bullshit.”

Nobody has said they have it all figured out. That’s why we’re still trying to figure it out

What’s the difference? Why do you care if it’s all nonsense?

Lol nah man there’s a ton of negativity in here now just like yours. Like I don’t think most of the people in here following Grusch are claiming it’s all true or we know all the answers. We’re mostly just fascinated and speculating on what it might be and you get a ton of naysayers coming in asking for sources and claiming bullshit on everything even when it’s very clearly speculative.

That's definitely some of us. As someone with a hard science background I pop in here from time to time when posts hit the front page and then nope back out again because there is nothing of value going on in here. I'm hoping one day I'll pop in and there will be some fantastic irrefutable evidence to blow my mind but I am not holding my breath.

I find a lot of the woo to be silly which is why I don’t really engage with it that much.

That's me. This sub's worst residents aren't the ones thay criticize or try to disprove things. It's the residents who believe everything posted, blindly, and who draw inferences where there legitimately aren't any. So many miss the important linchpin moments. Like, there is zero public evidence Grusch is speaking truly. He's provided none to anyone. He's made claims but none of those has been verified with actual proof. Everyone with proof says it's not their job to share. This sub, "Okay, I trust the government to give that proof." Also this sub, "I don't trust the government."

Yeah exactly what I was thinking too. I found the whole interview worthwhile though, and as a bonus it looks like I soaked up your downvotes for you ha.

David Grusch did come forward with evidence. He had names of those involved, both hostile and non-hostile. He needs to be in a secured setting in order to provide the kinds of documents that we want to see. I don’t know why people are still failing to see that whistleblowers can’t just release those things to us. There is a history of being threatened, blackmailed, and murdered. Surely you wouldn’t be willing to share information that could have you and your entire immediate family unalived. Edit: I also wanted to add that Fravor who testified at the hearing has his experience on video and radar. The pentagon released the video and confirmed it. If that isn’t considered evidence, then I have nothing more to say to you. There are a lot of examples of evidence of what is going on. If you want to keep your head in the sand, no sweat off my back.

Yes the government can stop people from coming forward. It’s called throwing your ass in jail for giving away state secrets. That is a very strong impediment to people whistleblowing

But thousands of people say that covid isn't real.

[removed]

What an insulting comment. It genuinely disgusts me to see people show this attitude towards a whistleblower with an ongoing investigation for illegal retaliation, who has come forward to try to share with humanity the truth about our place in the cosmos.

[removed]

On the contrary, he would likely have been known by the military before his public appearance, and by coming out to the forefront he has a level of protection now. If D Grusch dies suddenly, millions of people will hear that news and find it very suspicious! I hear your other points, if this is real then there’s obviously a lot more to the story then what Dave knows, but for now he’s all we’ve got to work with.

How does it protect yourself? The government and NSA will find out who you are. . . There is no anonymity anymore.

If he stays anonymous, all they have to do is figure out who's posting it and then take him out quietly. By making his name known, if anything happens to him, everyone would know something malicious happened to him. What you're saying is the opposite. He is not safer by being anonymous. Also if he was anonymous, no one would believe him. He'd just be another poster with a cool story like the 4chan guy. And if he posted his actual classified docs evidence they would be able to more easily identify him, making him more in danger because of his anonymity.

Again, he would be promptly arrested if he went that route or would need to flee the country like Snowden. He's going through the official legal channels. He is a true American patriot and does not want to break the law. He's not fine with letting it sit in a vault forever, hence him coming forward.

There would be a lot of name calling and finger pointing in the elite. For normal people life will go on. Until russia or china attacks the US for hiding alien technology (so good that they didn't use it at all).

A few things: They are not high ranking They are not speaking on behalf of the US government Grusch has only provided hearsay evidence However to me the biggest issue is believing info of this magnitude, arguably the most important information in human history, can stay classified for 70-80 years. There were at least three governments involved with this discovery in the 1930/1940, one of which was overthrown. Simply not possible. More recent evidence? Perhaps, but I still go back to the hearsay comment. If grusch had first hand accounts vs hearsay he would be much more believable.

There is likely higher chance that Grusch and general is crazy than that they legit have interdimensional aliens. For crazy people and generals we have good records on it happening. UFO witness rate correlates to pilot misinditification rate. There are ZERO records on alien bodies. Odds are heavy to side where Grusch and general is crazy.

The Senate Majority Leader, Chuck Schumer, is a Democrat, and probably tied for second with Nancy Pelosi as the most powerful Democrat in the country behind Joe Biden. He’s the main sponsor of the proposed legislation that specifically mentions “non-human” intelligence more than 20 times, along with UFO crash retrievals. With bipartisan cosponsors. Democrat Kirstin Gillibrand has been central in setting up the UFO office and has proposed other legislation. AOC was at the hearing. It’s probably one of the only bipartisan issues today. It currently does seem to lean Republican, at least in the UAP caucus. But not in the way you’re trying to portray. The Senate Democrat website specifically brings up “biological evidence of non-human intelligence” and “recovered technologies of unknown origin”.

He's said enough to shine a spotlight on the whole thing and what he was allowed to say was government approved so he's not risking his safety at all.

Thanks for the detailed response! I have to admit I'm not a fan of Coulthart for all his recent outlandish claims that are never backed up by evidence, but he's been right about a lot of things till now so I'm open to see what will come out of the ICIG's investigation. My hope is that the ICIG report comes out with actual findings, while at the same time some of the dozens of whistleblowers who supposedly corroborated Grusch come out simultaneously to back it up. Do you know if any of the actual names of the private companies, military and research facilities being alluded to hold this material can be named in the ICIG's report? Or would the disclosure bill have to pass first for that to be known publicly?

I usually stay out of this sort of exchange but I'll chime in.. On the one hand, those saying people like Grusch would face prison aren't wrong. He absolutely would. Comparisons to Snowden aren't wrong but...*BUT*.... *If* Grusch had the goods, Im talking monumental, earth-shattering proof he *could* actually just do what Snowden did. Easy to say but Snowden did so just because people are being wiretapped. Grusch has f-ing NHI. Once he dropped the bombshell, it wouldn't take long for people to demand he get special treatment. I mean, if he can back up everything he's said, the US government has much bigger problems than making an example of Grusch. In fact, unlike Snowden, people would definitely be tuned in and asking why the guy that freed Americans from decades of lies was being charged with anything. Point is, its not cut and dry with either argument. If nothing else, Snowden proved that jail isn't the absolute outcome. People forget that Snowden also sees himself as a patriot. It really depends what exactly each is patriotic about.

>Every comment I see about "they should just give it all up" makes me wonder if the person commenting would willingly toss their lives and their family's life away to be locked in prison and never have freedom again for some "greater good" So he doesn't want to be in prison so bad he is willing to let the world rot? The same world he and his loved ones live in? Give me a break. He would be the greatest hero in human history for opening the flood gates.

Wow man you got me, it's classified so...case closed, right?! Good grief. You people are a broken record. Can go on for decades believing the government are malicious liars(They are), but then suddenly pull a 180 and go into full blown delusion mode and believe the government is in the process of willingly snitching on itself because an INTELLIGENCE OFFICER(as in, literally a professional grifter) tells you some vague things you want to hear while providing zero evidence. Well at least we have a perfect case study for why the 'yellow cake' non-sense for Iraq worked as well as it did. Tell a loud minority what they want to hear and you'll get your manufactured consent for whatever fun and new malfeasance the government has cooked up.

Thank you, my thoughts exactly.

So this is actually just a cult, then?

If you took a second to think about it, it actually makes sense. Saying “the government knows aliens exist” is not the same thing as saying “We recovered a UFO on X date and have recovered Y technology from it” or “We’ve been in contact with aliens for decades and the truth about our relationship is X”. Keeping it vague is what is keeping the information classified thus keeping it legal

I’m still riding the fence with all of this, but my general take is that given what he’s disclosed and to whom (allegedly), and his seemingly following the letter of the law and chain of command, he’s got enough legal protection plus leverage otherwise that he can skirt through if he doesn’t foul up at least the legal protections end of the thing. Killing him outright or acting against him otherwise with these disclosures during an ongoing investigation relating directly to actions being taken against him for his whistleblowing would be problematic to say the least on a few fronts.

The mental gymnastics are the only way they can believe this grift.

He's been allowed to say the things he's said. There are things he can say and things he can't because of whistle blower laws. He's following the law so he doesn't end up like previous whistle blowers before those laws were a thing

It seems pretty straightforward to me brother, I’m sorry I can’t make it make sense to you. He’s utilizing the legal channels to report his findings and tip toeing around the issue to stay safe under whistleblower protection laws, etc. I can’t work your brain for you

You seem like a real human being

Facts, real talk you can see the ontological shock and stigma overriding basic fuckin research skills from normies

again, dog shit fits the description of non-human biologics. and in the newsnation interview he specifically uses the words "pilots" and "bodies". not that it matters since none of that is firsthand info.

We've been saying a lot of stupid shit for most of human history as well that exists among many cultures who had no contact. Doesn't mean if I eat something from an animal I'll gain it's powers just cause a bunch of different idiots said it a lot for a long time. All that says it's we aren't very creative and keep coming up with easy answers to common questions.

Answer me, what has he actually proved, other getting himself onto podcasts and in the media pretending he knows, but he can't say.Hes named in a book on amazon, so hel be earning royalties for it.

This is really the first rule of dealing with any institution. In my short time dealing with schools I got a remarkable amount done because I studied and could play the rules.

It was really telling during the hearing that he cited multiple codes and sections from memory while under questioning.

And I do as well, but Fravor is the equivalent to a beat cop vs Grusch as an internal affairs detective. Both incredibly important roles in policing but only one will be able to advance a narrative beyond initial reports and observations.

That's great because he's not asking for you to believe him. He's asking for his claims to be investigated.

It is a likelihood in the sense that people in Congress think the whole issue is enough of a concern to write a bill about the topic, but that is very different than OP's ludicrous claim that the Senate has affirmed existence.

This is not how English works. "The government shall exercise eminent domain over any X that may be controlled by Y" doesn't mean that Y has X.

Can we at least try to pretend to be English literate? > (12) NON-HUMAN INTELLIGENCE.—The term 20 ‘‘non-human intelligence’’ means any sentient intel- 21 ligent non-human lifeform regardless of nature or ul- 22 timate origin that may be presumed responsible for 23 unidentified anomalous phenomena or of which the 24 Federal Government has become aware. They are defining a term, not presupposing existence of said term.

He's playing the Greatest Hits of UFO coverups broken record. It's tremendously unexciting. Every time he opens his mouth, I become more convinced that he's just another UFO nut.

So to add.. would you agree that people with Autism are less likely to lie to others about known factual things?

Yet no-one declared having anything. Yes?

The problem is currencies. You are a slave to usury. You worship pieces of paper printed by a handful people. You exchange your valuable time and labor for pieces of paper. And the people that print that paper do not do such a thing. They simply print more when they need it. A cyclicly print more to buy more to own more when things crash. There is no difference between a $1 bill and a $100 bill, they are both pieces of paper from a printer. When that paper loses value, wars and empires must be established and maintained. This is the case in every horrible thing throughout history. Fiat currency, Modern banking is the consequence of every conflict and misery on earth. The abolishment of and current year capitalism needs to be priority. Any alien watching our society would laugh at the amount of control Central Banking has over us. It is a complete control by very few. It would be like us watching ants labor over dirt.

I thought it was asset accumulation. From savings and trustfunds to real estate and other investments. Some sort of maximum threshold could be implemented. For example: One can get up to a billion in accumulated wealth, but anything above is to be 100% taxed. This would of course never pass, but hey... we're speculating anyway.

not as simplistic as you make it sound. not everyone starts out greedy and money/power can get to anyone's head

Yeah I’ve been a bit of a spiritual wanderer myself for better part of a decade. The law of one material truly synchronized just about everything that I learned previously. Free will is of the upmost importance. We are all just here to explore what is right for us. Much love on the path 🤍

It's a nice idea, but there is no evidence for it. Ideology, tribalism, institutional pressure are all factors that drive conflict regardless of resources availability. And that's just from the top of my head. Post-scarcity society would be great, but to do that you have to control the population growth and live within the carrying capacity of the planet until you can start plundering another one. We are very far from that with an exploded population, over 50 years of overshoot and we've never set a foot on another planet. Unless the aliens give us a free warp drive, we are screwed.

Just a room temperature super conductor would be enough

We have a whole lot of uranium that could keep us going for a very long time. Nuclear power is currently the second safest form of getting energy behind solar. Our coal power plants have killed millions of people over the years but nuclear just spooks people unfortunately. If we start now with our new safe designs and build them right and place them right then we will also take out a huge part of our carbon footprint. The problem with nuclear plants and the reason they aren’t being built is they are very expensive to initially build and they take a long time to build. I still think it would be worth it to begin the switch completely. Even if we had a few meltdowns it would still be minor in the grand scheme of things. Also there is the oil companies which will do everything they can to stop this. They just want to make their money and don’t care about the future or our health. They care about keeping their executives able to afford private jets. Sadly it will be very hard to defeat these companies because guess who they happen to fund? More then just our government. Any decision maker with power. I can only hope the rest of the average population can come to this realization and find that we have more power then we realize if we use it right. We have a safer energy source that will be better for the future as we continue to improve overtime, we just need to make the switch completely.

It wouldn’t be a new element. All possible lighter more stable elements have been discovered. We also know about all possible elements in theory. The only new elements being created are so unstable they decay within microseconds to femtoseconds

yeah that not gonna work well in the thick forest in gray skys, long hard dark winter of Northwestern ,PA

So if I send you out in the woods naked and barehanded, you can build a solar panel?

Trees are at least renewable to an extent, and are effectively a net zero in the carbon cycle. Whereas fossil fuels are taking previously sequestered carbon and putting them into the atmosphere.

Pernicious argument, petroindustrial propaganda based on lies and false premises

We need to fully embrace nuclear power. At this point it is the only realistic alternative. The majority of the so-called "green energy" solutions are nowhere near as clean as people think. The materials required for solar panels and the batteries to store that energy have an alarming tendency to be mined by children in horrible conditions. The panels themselves only last a certain amount of time and then they aren't the kind of the thing you want littering landfills. China produces the majority of panels people are now buying (the few that can afford them that is) and we all know just how Green China isn't At the moment they are building new coal plants at a pace of one every other week. Unless we greatly expand nuclear energy then essentially nothing will change there simply isn't a reliable cheap substitute for fossil fuels. If we tried to stop all fossil fuels tomorrow society would fall apart and millions would be dead in a week. Way too many people have an unrealistic almost fanatical desire to switch from fossil fuels immediately and that's a pipedream. Even if we somehow just decided to stop using fossil fuels tomorrow and everyone could somehow afford an electric car, where do you think the electricity to charge the cars comes from? Mostly Coal. It honestly wouldn't make a whole hell of a lot of difference on a global scale. Not when China and other nations have no interest or capability to change their ways. People need to stop turning the climate into a religion where there can be no conversation without flying into a rage. We need to have calm reasoned and realistic discussion. Regardless humans will continue to do what we have always done, adapt and survive. Sitting in the middle of the highway with signs or glueing yourself to the wall beside some masterpiece isn't changing anyone's mind or making any positive difference. All that does is piss people off. Human innovation will continue and hopefully we can stumble on some new breakthrough or just maybe disclosure can help out. Maybe there is some brilliant alien zero point energy device locked away in a corporate hangar somewhere just waiting for us to make use of it. That's assuming of course that we can grasp how it works and replicate the materials necessary to build more. I have faith that something will change

Or we send them tons of solar panels so they don't have to use fossil fuels.

Unfortunately, bacteria have evolved that now eat dead trees rather than allowing them to be fossilized.

I'm more fond of the first option. Would require less assumptions and can be viewed to a more natural lens than the second option which requires more assumptions and is generally viewed through a humancentric lens.

Thanks ChatGPT reply.

primates do not exhibit greed, they exhibit survival instinct, but they also exhibit empathy. when you see a primate exhibiting greed it's you projecting onto the primate. the primate has no concept of greed, only survival. primates also don't emphasize the individual over the group, in fact i wouldn't even say humans do. i would say our brains are just all mixed up and we don't know what do think or do because capitalism isn't human nature and we're all acting like dogs in bowties

> Greed, often perceived as a uniquely human flaw Who the fuck has ever done that.

[deleted]

Yes, and the Law of one goes into this in so much depth. I don’t mean to be annoying recommending it, but I think most if not all here would really gain a lot from the material.

Or maybe they just have more time as a civilization than us.

Who is saying all the world's ants and bees work in collective harmony? Nature is a lot messier than that - being natural ourselves, we are understandably messy in the same exact ways.

Humanity will go extinct because of greed.

anyone who is preventing the next order of magnitude scaling in energy production and use, regardless of reason/source, is holding us back. We need abundant, cheap, energy density to power civilization’s future, and we may not just stumble upon unlimited clean zero point energy. We might still need to develop energy sources like fission that still may have undesirable consequences but at least push progress forward

Huh? Yeah we would and we are.

What does that have to do with Congress saying they're real?

Yeah, but fission is a basic process, like fire. It wasn't invented, it was discovered. So, to me, it's illogical to assume a reasonably advanced science based society would not have figured it out. There were naturally occurring "reactors" in Oklo. I see what you're saying, but fission isn't a great example imo.

Well thats not really the problem, if they don't know nuclear physics then they don't know how stars work. Your basically saying that they can travel through the universe, but have no idea about where stars get their energy from.

Splitting an element other than He is till splitting atoms

And we do the same to ourselves…

This, and also, a lot of the suffering we endure is needless due to the fact that the technologies and research dedicated to war could be instead dedicated to the advancement of humanity's quality of life overall. The research and tech pulled out of these craft are no different.

Just thought you might be interested in some unique data. I've been studying UFOs for more than 40 years, I just found something I've never heard before.

What makes you suspect that this is why they did what they did?

Ironically at the end, he talks about how he was sort of culturally-religious, went to school and became agnostic, and now finds himself coming full circle (his words) to believing it's actually very credible that we are created beings

Yeah I personally think demons could totally be real but just calling everything supernatural a demon is not a good look for humanity

I never suggested anything about ur character read my comment. I’m just kinda perplexed because what if, let’s just say, there’s an intelligence, either a race, a species, inter dimensional demons, or just one singer sentient being of energy. We don’t know what it is, not tryna assume ur Christian, but if you were to apply the Greek daemon concept… or the later developed Hellenistic demon concept to whatever it is…that’s just like from so long ago like do you know what ur saying exactly? Kinda like if you were to call a plane a metal dragon. For gods sake if we were to communicate individually with whatever it is one day stop making us look like cavemen

Demon implies EVIL. From what we know of NHI they are not Evil.

Funny how that works isnt it? Like rabid dogs.

I’ve been found out :(

Lol!

From the downvotes it looks like a lot of people don't agree with your theory.

A theory that immediately cast judgment on a sentient being, you’ve effectively put up a wall of negative association with the NHI. I guarantee any attempt of the beings showing you they are not evil will be met with skepticism on your part “The great deception” right. I work with guys who hold this view, there are whole podcast where people essentially lay out how these beings are demons going back to the mid evil era. It’s bigoted nonsense. This situation deserves an open mind, it’s out side of our overall zeitgeist and should not be labeled, good or bad until further evidence supports it. Imagine it the other way around. Other beings could think we are demons and evil with the way we behave as a whole, but there are good people a majority of us are good, and if you wanted to introduce your self to a un contacted planet you would not want them to think you are demonic.

Yes it could. But truth is we don’t know how DNA was formed. Coming to earth on an asteroid is a possibility However, it could also mean they evolved here on earth. Which means they could be from the future, or my personal theory is from the depths of the ocean

>Prison means nothing in this case if I was that guy. This is really easy to say when it's *not you* \- not your freedom, your family, your career, your money, your house, your reputation, or your own mental health. What he's doing now is *literally trying to expose the answer you want,* he's just doing it through means that won't damage his livelihood more than it already has. If that means a year or two working on opening up communications and trying to help establish proper legislative tools for real disclosure, that's *better* than him kicking this off by Snowden-ing himself, making the story easier to kill, and him being locked away or in exile. But please, reach out to him and let him know that he should ruin his life and go to prison because you're impatient. Or go hack the CIA and blow the whistle yourself.

>For me it’s the new age bullshit that gets me You mean like how the Agency has used astral projection for years

Like how the entire Air Force is run by Christian fundamentalists? Is that what you mean?

I never said I believed him. I’m speculating on his answers at face value. Sorry that Reddit upvotes and downvotes are the only thing you value in life.

Based on what? Because I know that UaP’s are real and that Grusch is obviously correct, and you are in denial? Me pointing out that his body language is positive and truthful makes me a narcissist? How does that even make sense

Hey I'm good at reading body language too. Who knew this made me a delusional narcissist as well, ha! On a serious note, I think anybody making this accusation to somebody on a social media site for saying they are good at picking up on language cues, is the actual delusion narcissist and needs to reevaluate their life Or they're an actual kid, I forget those are on here as well

What, he’s an alien?

Because if he does he gets thrown in prison.

Omg yes. It seemed like just yesterday for me when I got a Blackberry with the scroll wheel and my boss at the time said to me "why do you need to have access to your email all of the time?". He had one about 6 months later. Lol.

wonder what would happen if i just stopped using my phone

That is unfortunate because in 2045 we get enslaved by AI. Luckily the AI brand is a peace symbol and it makes all human slaves wear tie dye jump suits.

In my opinion. It isn’t. In fact, it honestly weighs probably more in favor for religion than atheism. All these religions have been talking about this stuff and people have been calling them crazy for thousands of years. Especially the Christians , Muslims and Jews who while having different practice of faith. They seem to have that fact in common. While also having the additional support of these texts being certified ancient historical texts. Makes you think doesn’t it ?

Only humans need to be saved because humans uniquely fell from grace. There’s no reason to believe another intelligent species also fell from grace like the traditional Christian understanding of humanity and our “original sin”.

That would be amazing.

Better yet, what if we could ask the NHI what their thoughts are on what lies beyond death? Almost like getting another point of view on life (literally).

Their favorite sport

« Knowledge » lmao

Yea I agree with that, they were talking for example about some story in the Bible where a prophet or someone’s hands were marked in some way, and then that being accepted as an alien encounter and it being radiation burns on his hands. I just don’t see religious people willing to make such a big jump to practical, real world interpretations like that.

It wont make sense as we have evidence that what Muhammed brought as revelation already spoke about NHIs and that they will say exactly that to confuse people !! So proofs the same point

🤣

Yup, we are the smartest of the 8 living Great Ape species.

I was being downvoted for being skeptical that evidence exists &#x200B; "The fuck ahahaha"

OR - that there is no evidence.

[removed]

I am not speaking for everyone. I am telling you what the WILD MAJORITY of the world population thinks. Until there is evidence most people will not care at all.

you disqualified yourself to be seen as a rational thinking individual if you really believe its plausible that they officially allowed him to say the US has retrieved alien crafts and bodies but then draw the line when he wants to say where they are. if true they would have drawn the line way earlier. its naive as fuck if you just eat these wolf tickets right up these folks are selling with so many glaring red flags

I'm going to offer you a big hug. I get your hopeful outcome. BUT if such a coverup was perpetuated for as long as it has been with murder to keep it secret. Shining light on that is probably not going to have a utopian resolution. Rather the oppressors have no reason to keep up the masquerade of letting freedom ring.

exactly, well said

I mean I at least have more perspective than you. And I’ll take your advice. I’ll read “all the leaked documents” which conveniently don’t include any documents that offer actual proof. I don’t believe things without proof. I’m not religious. 🤷🏻‍♀️

We have different definitions of "credible" it seems like. I'd believe in aliens. But it's going to take a hell of a lot more than "someone said so". Like I keep saying. Show. Me. The. Goddamn. Evidence.

Except we only heard him say that he talked to people and they said this and that. If they deny it’s just their word against his and you won’t even hear about it because it will happen behind closed doors. He might be credible and I find him charismatic and I do root for him but at the end of the day you don’t know him, at all, you don’t know any of them and to say that we don’t need any evidence because we have his word is kinda silly und unreasonable. Let’s put it this way, let’s say we just make the step and believe it all. What’s next?You kinda have to think it through here because the next step needs to happen too as we can’t just move on with our life’s and not wanting to see that alien tech and the biologics , not to mention the implications such a colossal reveal would have on our society?Or are we in a phase now where first lots of books have to be sold and the taxpayer money needs to be milked to research UAP making the very same people at the top of the spear rich in the process only do we arrive at the same point one day where we want to see actual proof. Rinse and repeat.

These people around Elizondo sure act as if they have it all figured out but cant tell because "nda you know"

I care about UAP. I dont care about these talking heads that just muddy the water with all their pseudo knowledge and trust me bro sources.

I hope the [Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Disclosure Act of 2023](https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/uap_amendment.pdf) passes with the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). If there’s something to find, this piece of legislation has created a guide on how they will go about collecting, releasing information and analyzing NHI craft/technology/bodies.

It just depends. Earlier, someone posted that interview Knapp did with that dude who claimed an abduction type encounter. Typically I wouldn’t have gotten past a minute or two of the video and moved on from the post, but in this case it was clear to me that he had simply experienced sleep paralysis because it’s something I’ve dealt with before. Obviously, nothing but downvotes when I pointed this out because “I’m just parroting what I’ve heard and know nothing about sleep paralysis.” Lol.

Right. The dichotomy of “the government has been hiding this for a century!” and “I’m certain the government will make the government disclose all they’ve been hiding!” is completely lost on some. I find it interesting to ask some of these people what their over/under is for when disclosure will happen.

Give me a break. These dudes are coming out for public interviews, but are too afraid for their lives to show actual evidence? What evidence has anybody released? And I’m not talking about first hand accounts backed up by blurry IR video that’s already been debunked.

Oh please, he isn't a saint. You should be disgusted with how he treats whistleblowing as a means to get paid making interviews and appearances. He demeans anyone who actually has real information. How do the people he is claiming told him things feel with him collecting appearance fees? You think he has super important info and you're OK with him risking his life in public for social media appearances? How does that make sense?

How does dying suspiciously protect him? He'd still be dead. Look at JFK, Epstein, and so on. Do you really think that if he needed to be silenced, that being in the public eye would change anything? Yes, he would have a personnel file with the military, but that doesn't mean he is automatically known as the leaker. It's possible to do things in secret. Now that he's very loudly in public making these claims, he can't leak anything. If anything all his clamor is working to ensure we will never know. He's worse than useless.

I mean yeah, if you go on TV and announce to the world that you know all the secrets, the NSA is going to have an easy time tracking you down. Too late to stay anonymous for this guy.

That's why you don't "post" it, you leak it to a qualified third party that protects its sources.

If he's correct though, this will make Snowden's leaks look insignificant. He is saying there are secrets he has access to that would fundamentally change humanity's understanding of itself, the universe, the very fabric or reality. And his personal comfort is more important than that? Really? He lacks conviction.

Possibly yeah, I guess it’s hard to say. Don’t you think people would be more upset about all the gaslighting that has gone on throughout the years? I’m not religious so can’t really comment there, but imagine lots of people would take a few days off to process things and maybe pray about it? That sort of disruption to the global supply chain could put a kink in things. Idk really, interesting to think about tho.

That’s incorrect. Marco Rubio said that “many” high-ranking officials are testifying to the same claims Grusch is making, with firsthand knowledge or involvement. And the IG found his claims “credible and urgent”. So that’s incorrect too. And then of course there’s the Schumer amendment, which directly reflects Grusch’s claims. All of which the media is grossly misreporting on.

I’m not from the US so maybe don’t have all the facts straight, but as I understand it the Inspector General is a pretty high rank within the MIC isn’t it? There’s also the likes of Commander Fravor, and others which I’m blanking on right now. It is only hearsay evidence but that’s why an investigation is needed - to see if there is anything to all the claims! Don’t pull a Neil Degrasse Tyson - claiming there is no evidence without looking. Do tend to agree on the secret being so big that how could it have been kept, Altho counter point to that would be that it hasn’t really been a secret per se, there has always been rumours, most just choose not to believe them. You don’t think it’s worth investigating the work that David Grusch did to see if it can be verified?

Haha well there’s a first for everything, eventually the answer will be aliens! 😅 But in all seriousness, you could be right. What I want to see is some proper investigation done by Congress and the Senate into the SAPs that Grusch said exists, and what happens with the NDAA 2024. If all of this amounts to nothing then I will be happy to have egg on my face and go back to sleeping soundly at night.

It’s not bipartisan at all. The VAST majority of support for this UAP whistleblower stuff has all been republicans with a couple democrats. The democrats aren’t the ones talking about it all the time in the press and giving sound bites either. Just republican reps. Y’all are being played.

I doubt we will see much of the report, if any, unfortunately. I’m more interested in seeing how Congress reacts to it.

Why do you think that the moment he says “the truth”, the world will just suddenly change? Like the people who have covered this up for decades will just say “oh dang, yep we’ve been covering it all up, sorry guys”. And people won’t just suddenly shift their world view based on one guy’s word, no matter how much evidence there is. Some people still think the earth is flat, ffs. Most people will only believe it if it comes from a current official government source, which Grusch isn’t. It’s a huge gamble. People may or may not believe it, but he’s going to jail either way. Not really a good approach

You are assuming that something would change if grusch revealed classified info, the only thing that matter is that the ones in the programs admit it or the congress uses full force to find the evidence, only that will change something, everything else can be easily discredited.

It's why he earned a TS-C security clearance and you didn't

This is exactly why you'll never have the level of access Grusch has, you've revealed yourself to be a traitor.

>it's classified so...case closed, right? Yeah, now you're getting it. But then again, after reading the rest of your post it's pretty clear that you're unable to comprehend what's really going on. Maybe the downvotes will explain it to you, lol. Some people on Reddit take the lead on being oblivious, you must be one of those folks.

They just outright make up new classified and whistleblower laws.

I wish you, or any of the zealots that mass downvote anyone questioning Grusch, could actually point to any point in time where the government willfully snitches on itself and reveals overwhelming malevolence for absolutely no benefit of their own(And quite the contrary, in fact), as well as willingly giving up supposed tech advances in the process. No, seriously, I want to hear the mental gymnastics where you can actually convince me that the same people that actively lie to you constantly to manufacture consent for ludicrous wars, wealth transfers, and attacks on your rights are now suddenly altruistic and honest. Further, I'd love to hear you explain how this process works where everything that could possibly back up claims like bases with UFO's and aliens is 'classified', but mentioning them is totally fine.

Literally just watch the testimony. He is asked if we have the bodies of the pilots, and he said yes. Non-human intelligence, the phrase he most commonly uses, has a statutory definition. I would suggest reading it. And the fact that it is not firsthand is irrelevant, when Rubio confirmed that first hand witnesses spoke to the SSCI.

[removed]

No answer me first what book or gtfo

This rule applies to all aspects of living in any environment with rules.

I agree. good comment and you have the best user name I've seen in years.

I don’t know if it’s that ludicrous. It seems like a step away from positive confirmation. Schumer himself said something along the lines of “the American people have the right to learn about non-human intelligence”. That seems pretty close to the edge there. I think they’re just waiting until they can “kick the tires” (assuming it’s real) before they make a confirmation like that, which I get.

I know, but the may is referring to the control/possession, not the existence. I'm saying this clause doesn't support either one of you and is nonrelevant to the conversation. It was wrong of you to highlight the word may after saying what you said since it makes it look like you think that means "may exist".

Essentially the sections they should be quoting are: "Legislation is necessary because credible evidence and testimony indicates that Federal Government unidentified anomalous phenomena records exist that have not been declassified". While defining unidentified anomalous phenomena records, NHI and technologies of unknown origin in pretty specific detail.

*Riiiiight*, I guess the years of IG testimony from dozens of firsthand whistleblowers that led to that legislation being drawn up in the first place that directly referenced NHI crash retrievals had absolutely *nothing* to do with it at all—mere happenstance—they were just being proactive and objectively defining it “*just in case*...” not like anyone ever told them such things already existed outside of oversight with mountains of supporting evidence or anything. 😂🤣 “*Has become aware*” not “*would become aware*” 🎻 ^(🎻) *^(world’s smallest violin)*

I think he actually knows better. I think he knows what he's saying isn't true.

It's literally the Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Disclosure Act that defines non-human intelligence, declares that the USA and Congress have been improperly denied access under misuse of classification and the Atomic Energy Act, that such things exist and must be turned over and declared, claims authority oversight on the topic, and is supported by the National Security Council, which is literally the heads of the Executive Branch including Biden. I mean, once that passes the House (another few weeks) and then Biden, that's the United States Government declaring that the topic is real. Right now, it's the US Senate declaring it so. Once the House passes it, that's the House declaring it so. Once the White House signs it, that's the combined totality of the US government declaring it so.

I think we are very passionate about our beliefs. If we believe that truth & change is more valuable than personal ideals, then yeah. The problem is, even "fact" is mostly just word of mouth. You "know" what a black hole looks like & roughly how they function as a fact, yet you've never seen one. So to put it simply, I think we are less likely to lie about things we believe as fact, even if it's something we've been manipulated into believing or something we convince ourselves is fact to keep a part of our soul intact.

They declared it by passing it: > Legislation is necessary because credible evidence and testimony indicates that Federal Government unidentified anomalous phenomena records exist...

"There is no difference between a $1 bill and a $100 bill, they are both pieces of paper from a printer." That may be true, but it is not the actual physical properties of money that matter it is what it represents, and what everybody accepts it represents.

Money - “Hey I don’t have that wood block I normally trade you for food. How about you hold onto this/use this other valuable thing instead?” repeat 1000x over until we are at a point today, where we use money to represent **stuff** because you will not always have **stuff** that someone else needs. “Paper money is bad” is a stupid argument. This is just Alex Jones level “Babylon money prison system!” nuttery, especially when you accuse someone who disagrees with you of having “federal reserve hands [that] typed this” Please, tell me what you’re going to give me for your next $1100 phone. It better not be “money” or “food”, and I don’t need your labor. Arguing for the end of money is basically arguing for the end of civilization, unless you’ve got a *really* convincing counter argument.

The way I feel about the law of one, is even if it's all bullshit it's what religion was supposed to be about, in my atheist/agnostic opinion. Love, kindness, and compassion regardless of what the person is on the outside. I like that it has ideas that focuses on the idea "WE" are not our bodies or appearance. I can lose half my body in an accident and will remain 'me'. we are more than or physical shells, and love should be applied to all. If this were a major religion (as it is ON PAPER, please miss me with the pedantic "but people....") the world would be a better place

Easy, we'll just drop our room temperatures. It's gonna sucks at first, but you'll get used to it.

We have much less uranium than you think. I always thought we had enough uranium for thousands of years, but we actually have less than one hundred years, and that's at current consumption rates, which will probably increase. Thorium might last us a long time. "The demand for uranium continues to increase, but the supply is not keeping up. Current uranium reserves are expected to be depleted by the end of the century, and new sources of uranium are hard to find. " https://encoreuranium.com/uranium/the-future-of-nuclear-energy/#:~:text=Current%20uranium%20reserves%20are%20expected,doubling%20of%20prices%20by%202030.

My new pet theory is inevitable nuclear power plant necessity to avert climate change will mean many more UFOs, hence why disclosure is happening

I have no clue about this and am not doubting you, but is this like a *final* thing that is completely impossible to change, or is it just the commonly held beliefs of relevant proffesionals and academics? Again, not doubting, I just have never heard this before and am interested how we know what we know and how we know it is the final word, y'know?

Yeah, it's not like an electricity cable network currently exists or anything so I guess those places are shit out of luck.

Wind mills and Water mills are a thing and humans have used these energy sources for thousands of years.

Just about as easily as you in the exact same scenario can find coal or strike on an oil deposit and somehow viably use it.

Lmao like you'd be blacksmithing yourself a steam engine in that scenario. Even for this lunatic sub, what a ridiculous comment. Just wow.

They’re not renewable when you need to cut a whole one down each day and burn it just to keep warm and cook food. This is the cause of deforestation in Madagascar, and why Haiti is deforested

cool let’s hear yours

100% correct. There is nothing "green" or "clean" about solar and wind. Even if they were a clean source of energy, you're dependent on the sun shining or the wind blowing to harvest that energy. Our tax dollars need to quit subsidizing inefficient energy methods that makes us reliant on China for our modern way of life. The child and slave labor in the mining and manufacturing process is unconsionable, not to mention the horrible environmental impact of depleted batteries, solar panels, and windmills. The toxic components being thrown away (or buried in the case of windmill blades) since there's no safe, efficient, or cheap way to recycle them. Those buried components leak their toxins into the ground water. Real "clean" when food you eat is poisoned by that water. Nuclear is the way. Quit wasting money subsidizing green - all it does is line China & globalists pockets and screw over the poor. Research fusion. All of the climate zealots should quit using all technology, not wear the majority of clothes, and definitely not glue themselves to price an ass absurd point. All of those products require petroleum products, making them idiotic hypocrite!

well said!

not enough steady state energy to fuel the transition from burning wood to stay alive to modernity

Ohhhhh shit, you got me. That’s interesting, some organic matter surely will still get fossilized tho I’d imagine? Idk about how unfortunate it is tho. Seems kinda like whatever.

Well spotted. I typed it all up and it just improved my response. I do it with most of my communications.

If capitalism isn't human nature, why is it by far the dominant global economic system?

I’m Christian and I believe they are demonic. You don’t have to agree but I believe I will be vindicated in the future. I also think that people who share my view will be better off in the long run.

Biblical evil is not necessarily the same as what people generally think of as evil. If they are demons in the Christian sense then they will be anti-Christ, but they could appear as benevolent in other ways.

This is the Christian esoteric bullshit 4chan keeps spouting. Dude needs to go back to /x/

There are also angels that remain on the side of God, so I’m not saying they’re all evil.

Okay

/s?

No I value answers, that's why I ask. It's just downvotes are the only answer they have to questions. You should be sorry that the most convinced people have nothing but speculation that they don't want to think about as their evidence. Similar to you thinking vague unverifiable responses are better for psychology than just laying out facts

They’re claiming to be able to read this man’s mind because of his body language. Come on man. Even real body language experts agree that it is not a hard science and can easily be mistaken.

Depending on how much you use it for, you would initially be stressed the eff out, but after a few days you would most likely be much more balanced our mentally and emotionally than you have been in years. Standard withdrawal cycle.

I basically did this, I generally keep my phone on do not disturb until I'm home and ready to go through what I've missed. If I'm out of the house you just have to wait until I'm home again to reach me. It definitely leads to some inconveniences, but it mostly eliminates the possibility of unplanned stress entering my life until I'm ready to receive it. My friends and loved ones have gotten used to it and they know that I probably won't be reachable by phone at any given time

Sign me up.

This made me chuckle, and cry

It’s why Korean Jesus is so ripped. He does a lot do gymnastics.

Yes, people who are genuinely bought into religions, especially evangelizing ones, feel deeply convinced enough to encode their doctrine as knowledge or objective truth - that's kind of the whole concept of 'faith'. For those folks, especially if raised in orthodox communities, it's a core part of their belief that some non-human intelligence interacts with humans. Low-effort dogmatic thinking isn't exclusive to religious people, as your comment illustrates.

>I just don’t see religious people willing to make such a big jump to practical, real world interpretations like that. I understand why people might think this, it just often plays out the exact opposite in reality. That's the challenge of this topic, and the bridge that needs gapped. Religions have been proselytizing stories of non-human, transcendental encounters for centuries, while more global, science-driven, secular society is a much more recent phenomena. Now we're better able to collect quantitative data about things that once seemed esoteric and unreachable, and it's possible that we'll come to a point (or are already at a point) where we have to square up some things between the two to make sense of it, even if it's just a semantic change. It's telling that one of the biggest opponents (or at least bitter, argumentative skeptic) of a visitation hypothesis these days is Neil deGrasse Tyson.

Ok?

Yes maybe that’s the case, so let’s investigate to found out? (Although there is a lot of circumstantial evidence, such as the Nimitz, Gimble, various eye witnesses over the years) I understand the skepticism but here is a guy who would be in the know, saying the military have these things and are covering it up, so therefore the logical thing to do would be to investigate his claims, would it not? I’m assuming you understand that my stance here isn’t radical 😅 just a guy wanting to know the truth, not taking people at face value.

[removed]

Got any evidence that you speak for the WILD MAJORITY?

Your position doesn’t make sense. See my above point about knowing that the US military has classified missions, classified sensor platforms, we know these exist but we don’t actually know anything of substance about them. If you can’t see and understand this basic premise, then I can say you disqualify yourself from thinking objectively.

The funny thing about power, is it’s only useful if there’s someone you can exert it over.

Thats what you think. But ive been in the Military as Well. So id recommend to stop guessing what people know and dont know, bc chances are you just look like someone who tries to push their ego on the Internet. Nothing personal from my side. Still hope you'll have a great day.

The 40 witnesses are all inside the government and have spoken to Grusch personally, and he said that he had known many of them for years prior to them disclosing to him. So, your definition of “credible” is complete hogwash. Unless **you** have got a background in intelligence?? Multiple witnesses who spoke to Grusch have also given corresponding testimony to the ICIG. So, nobody really cares what **you** think and it’s kind of vain and annoying that you think you’re an authority on shit because you arrived here from r/all or what the fuck ever.

Literally nobody has come close to or acted like they know what’s going on. Are they not allowed to speak on things they may be privy because they are beholden to a document that can send them to jail? Yes. People in this sub and /aliens sub and others like it are fairly low IQ since they don’t understand any context or can read between lines or understand when something is or isn’t said it tells you a lot. People here want it in a platter for all to see and i can tell you that is not coming nor how it works.

As someone who cares about UAP, you seem to post pretty negatively across the sub. Can you point me in the direction of some good sources that made you believe in UAP if none of the current talking heads are any good?

See, this is where you lose rational people. Your comment really pre-supposes that there are NHI behind all this. That is the most phenomenal leap from the evidence available.

That’s what I thought as well. As soon as he started talking about things floating through his ceiling. It sounded like sleep paralysis and a really weird vivid nightmare.

Show us how he's getting paid? What appearance fees? This is the best talking point you could come up with? What a bunch of nonsense. LOL.

Yeah, I’m sure Grusch absolutely loves being ridiculed by the media, and having his private struggles with PTSD leaked. Just give it up bro. If you don’t believe him, then your entitled to your opinion. But at least wait until his investigation has concluded before making snide comments about him being a bullshitter.

If he hadn’t gone public then we wouldn’t even be having this conversation so I don’t think it’s fair to say he’s done damage to the Disclosure movement… Hmm I sort of get your points but not sure I agree with the conclusion. Sort of hard to say anything for sure isn’t it haha. JFK and Epstein remind me that even when the public knows about these people dying, we still don’t get given the full story 😕

In what world can a government employee stay anonymous. The amount of people who have access to this information is minimal. Phones and email can be traced. Even snail mail this day in age can be traced. They will know who published the information, they will be able to track this down. He wouldn't have been able to stay anonymous. That's what I am saying.

Good luck protecting sources against the NSA, FBI, and CIA.

Okay so you want him to sacrifice his own life to get the truth out?

Rubio's comment is also hearsay. The IG is not a seeing oracle. Their job is to ensure the rules are followed. In this case they are supporting the process for a whistleblower claim to go forward. That should not be construed to mean there is anything behind the claim, just that it should go forward. Schumer is, to his credit, trying to force the DOD/IC to come clean. His amendment: >would mandate government records related to Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) carry the presumption of disclosure. His amendment is to enhance transparency, which is great. It does not prove/disprove Grusch's claim. Some people want to believe, I get it. But the information is hearsay - she said/I heard/"many" military members, etc. However, yntil we get a reputable person that comes forward and says "here is where I work and this is what I did/saw" the discussion is conjecture.

Just to be clear here, when you say "Marco Rubio" you mean the senator from Florida, right? For a group of people who believe in massive government conspiracies you sure are naive.

Yes, after 200 000 years people on mars could change to the point that they look alien. If you rely on wast universe and chance then bad news. Chance does not work like that. Not everything can happen because universe is so big. So there can be no eventially. Im very sure that this will amount to nothing and aliens here believers will find just another excuse on why government lied to them and in reality aliens were there.

Recently like two Republican reps have talked about it, along with Marco Rubio. Gillibrand also has, AOC, and Chuck Schumer, probably the most powerful Democrat besides Biden, personally sponsored a 64-page bill about UAP records, “non-human” intelligence and biologics, and eminent domain over “technologies of unknown origin” related to UAP. Also given the number of times “the President” was mentioned, Biden’s administration (a Democrat) was overwhelmingly likely to have been involved in it’s crafting. Not partisan at all huh? Sorry. Try another narrative.

Damn, that's a bummer, but I expected it. I think I'll take a break from this subreddit now that David has come out with this interview (I was waiting to hear from him again after the hearing). I've been tuning in to this since 2017, and sometimes it can get exhausting. Still, I hope that the bill passes and that we'll see more movement from Congress in the coming months. I'm also curious about AARO and NASA's upcoming reports, although my gut tells me they'll be nothing-burgers once again... Cheers and never lose hope! 🤜🤛

>You are assuming that something would change if grusch revealed classified info, He said there is basic science that should be taught in schools. That information can be verified by scientists.

And he's not doing shit with it when he has all the info.

The DoD cleared Grusch to speak. We're you not aware of that?

All those downvotes are from geniuses that never did any research on Grusch and blindly take claims from government sock puppets at face value as long as it lines up with their personal beliefs. And as we know, correctness on reddit is directly correlated with it's idiotic 'popularity contest' censorship system where posts are hidden according to if a majority simply doesn't like what the person has to say. FFS he's a [professional liar](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/GO/GO06/20230726/116282/HHRG-118-GO06-Bio-GruschD-20230726.pdf) . Literally a government disinfo agent with a career in information warfare. Yeah, wow, totally the most trustworthy guy. Good grief.

Ever played telephone? Until someone actually provides proof, aliens aren't real and it's certainly just another SR71 type project the government is trying to keep under wraps. His position and his friends positions don't grant them any more credibility than someone like Lazar. *yeah we can get up to a significant % of C but man those power-lines on earth are a real bitch* lmao

Posted the link above read

> I'm saying this clause doesn't support either one of you No. OP is making a positive claim of existence. I highlighted the only text I could find that could possibly be misconstrued to support OP's claim. The text I highlight doesn't support OP's claim, as it doesn't actually affirm existence.. OP is welcome to pull alternate text, if I missed something critical in the bill.

Which still is not Congress saying materials exist. You're conflating a section where the bill states records are *likely* not being properly reviewed for classification (which is what the section actually says, not what you write) with the sections where they laundry list literally anything that could potentially be hidden away. Creating an exhaustive list to ensure no stone is unturned is not the same as a statement of belief of existence.

...have you ever authored legislation? "Has become" is exactly how you would write this. "X means any Y the federal government has become aware of." This does not presuppose Y, it is an encompassing definition for X. "Would become aware of" makes no grammatical sense in this context, and in fact would provide an easy dodge to any disclosure. > No, I guess the months of IG testimony that led to that legislation that directly referenced NHI crash retrievals had nothing to do with it and they were objectively defining it “just in case.” This is irrelevant to how the English language works. "...any [fraud, bribery, tax evasion, overdue library books, ...] of which the federal government has become aware" would not mean that the bill authors are presupposing any of these actually existing. You only write a bill to cover eventualities you consider plausible, so certainly someone is thinking this may be real. But there is no "disclosure" in this bill itself as written.

Who has an alien? Nobody declares it. They passed a legislation. They did not declare having aliens.

Yes, and in the material they speak on how their information in multiple civilizations was eventually distorted. I think every time in the manner of an elite being formed, and the belief/practice that this info is only for the elite. And yes, the idea of the “we” and that every being has a choice-in this density and ‘beyond’. I think I am finding we as humans keep creating the ‘elite’ in every section we can. It’s like we’re desperate for someone else to have the answer for us. If that makes sense. I see it in the most spiritual of places, even when the teacher will say to not to do that—the student still holds their breath for their next word. Idk it’s been an interesting thought swirl to go down, you see it everywhere. And my message keeps bringing me back to “you *literally* have everything you need inside of you”

So basically, an element is defined by the number of protons in the nucleus. The periodic table is just a list of all nuclei in ascending order of the number of protons and it is continuous. It currently contains all elements from 1 proton (Hydrogen) to 118 protons (Oganesson) with no gaps, with all newly discovered ones ending up on the tail end of the table. There are no gaps between 1 and 118 and obviously you can't have an element with, say, 3.5 protons, or sqrt3 protons etc, so any currently unknown element will have to have more than 118 protons.

It's not a matter of perspective of some people. Changing everything from our understanding of periodic table would be equivalent to uprooting our understanding of gravity for example. We expect objects to fall on earth and massive objects to attract each other the same way we expect elements in the periodic table to interact with each other in a specific way. And there's 300 hundred years of experiments and technology that lead us to everything we have, because elements in the periodic table behave the way we expect them to. Still elements naturally conform to their lowest energy state possible in a given enviroment. And there's possibility that some elements may behave differently than what we expect them in a different enviroments (on earth its obviously the easiest to conduct experiments in it's 1 atmosphere, room temperature enviroment, but there's more to it than this).

Did you miss the point about the energy the sun gives? No one was talking about current electrical grids.......

Electricity has a limit on how far you can transmit it safely and usefully. Otherwise, we'd just build one giant fuck all of a nuclear reactor in the Mojave and power the country. Decentralization plays a part, but it's hard to get power down the line across hundreds of miles, let alone thousands. If all it would take is covering Death Valley for the western hemisphere and another in Africa and one more in Asia, in solar panels then there wouldn't be a problem. Just make 3 fields individually capable of supporting the globe and as we rotate there's always power. But, we can't because it's impossible.

To make bread… not electricity.

No. A solar panel is not like coal or oil. Solar panels have many different parts and need a sophisticated infrastructure to producw energy. Coal and oil just need to be put on fire.

No, it’s not as easy. That’s why we still haven’t mastered solar power.

not with that attitude!

So you honestly think society could have made ships with solar power instead of coal? That’s insane. You need energy to build the infrastructure to get that energy. Coal is self-contained. I’m not a smith but I do have plenty of work experience as a forge-tech and a lab-technician for analyzing forged metals, so I know something about working with and shaping hot metals. Probably more than you have done.

But you can plant more trees, you can't put fossil fuels back into the ground.

That's a matter of numbers, surely. Too many humans consuming too much wood causes deforestation. A small enough number can consume a sustainable amount.

It really is incredible and will eventually replace a lot of jobs.

Because it became the dominant economic system by force through imperialism. Europeans brought capitalism around the globe when they claimed the whole rest or the world as their territory in the 18th through 20th centuries. Nations that resisted have been destroyed and rebuilt by capitalist powers. If you looked at the world 500 years ago would you believe that feudalism is human nature too? A better question is if you looked at the world 20,000 years ago would you assume that communal living without hierarchy is true human nature? You're comment reminds me of a quote that goes something along the lines of "To only look at humans under capitalism and assume human nature is to be greedy is no different than only looking at humans working in a coal mine and assume human nature is to cough."

Not in public. No problem if you're not interested, that just means you may not be ready.

Insufferable. Even in the UFO community lol

You're not going to be vindicated by shit. Take your brainwashed cult crap elsewhere.

That’s so scary to me. How could you label something so unknown as being so evil? This is literally xenophobia like racism and homophobia. Just sad that while we try and make peace you want to make war

If anything, your religion is going to completely fall apart once they start showing up and talking to the rest of us, because they will be proof that God does not exist, and never could have. I honestly cannot wait for the Church as an institution to fail. Religion has thwarted mankind's evolution for thousands of years, and has been the justification for countless genocides.

Lol I knew that demonic would be the Christian way out of this if they accept it at all

Lol, I do believe that's an accurate assessment.

You are a lost cause

I'm sure the technologies we have today would be considered sci-fi 2000 years ago.

Nope you seem uninformed

I want answers too. I no doubt believe we see being visited by *something* but the answers lie far away from any governmental administration. Grusch needs to point to evidence. Spectators also need to realise that the evidence he provides is secondary.

Read his mind? I can read body language. That is a skill for those who have the ability. It is real. I am not making it up. It is clear that he is telling the truth based on his body language. May I ask, are you stupid?

Go out into society and start talking to everyone about aliens and tell me what they think of you.

i think we are having totally different discussions my friend of course the US has hidden tech, i mean obviously, no one is denying that not even the government themselves take radar for example. they are allowed to say "yes we have radars" but thats about it. they arent allowed to talk specifics, like resolution, software hickups, limits etc the equivalent to what you think is happening with all these NDA whistleblowers would be: "we have very sophisticated radars, they have operational ranges up to 500 miles and a resolution where we can distinguish individual golf balls right next to each other. they can be jammed with wavelengths from x to y, which causes a lot of trouble. oh but i cant tell you how the radar looks like or show you an image because thats classified haha my nda you know" no, they arent allowed to talk about specifics way way earlier. yet you think its plausible that these guys are cleared to spill the beans about aliens and craft retrievals but the government draws the line when they are asked about where they are. it makes zero sense. he was cleared to talk about that stuff for a simple reason: because it isnt classified. if the US doesnt have aliens, then theres no reason why talking about it would be classified. them allowing him to tell all these fairytales isnt acknowledgement or proof that its true. it just means that the government doesnt see that any classified information is being compromised.

Thats why the NHI outcome is so alluring. They are this nebulous out-side-context problem for the powers that be. They COULD be the sword that cuts the Gordian Knot of the entrenched power structures. My issue with that is if there is a coverup about thier existence and technology then either they can't solve that problem, or they've been co-opted by the entrenched power structures.

What, you and this bunch alone own exclusive rights to discuss UFOs? Lol, no you don't. For one thing, I see what you're doing. You're not actually arguing, you people just go right slinging personal insults and devaluing the worth of anyone who doesn't instantly agree with you. The only people's who's opinions matter to you are the people you already agree with. If YOU don't want people in here to argue, then get your fucking subreddit taken off r/all, and limit posts. Be a real conspiracy sub and just ban anyone who's a skeptic. It'll save you same time, honestly.

> The 40 witnesses are all inside the government and have spoken to Grusch personally, and he said that he had known many of them for years prior to them disclosing to him. That sounds like one source of information dude. If I claim to have spoken with 100 people who told me something, but I don't tell you anything about those 100 people, would you consider that 100 sources of information? If Grusch is full of shit, then you can't use anything he "says" happened as evidence of anything. >So, nobody really cares what you think and it’s kind of vain and annoying that you think you’re an authority on shit because you arrived here from r/all or what the fuck ever. I never claimed anyone cares about what I think, but I'm sure they care about what I think just as much as they care about what you think. You're really huffing some copium right now because you got jack shit from all this hoopla the past few months. It was supposed to be this big reveal, and now it's turning out to be a drip feed of nothing.

read between the lines "mr elizondo, have you seen a real alien spacecraft?" elizondo just smiles "WOAH read between the lines, he actually confirmed alien anti gravity spaceships that are probably transmedium and interdimensional" yeah, really high iq you have - yoda

You can believe there is something to the phenomenon without subscribing to the majority of stuff floated about in the ufo community. The subject is full of myths and regurgitated stories that were rejected in the last century yet never die in the ufo bubble.

im intrigued by the possibility that we have found alien crafts somewhen or that germany or nicola tesla discovered some sort of advanced energy system. im also having fun identifying objects in the sky. what i cant stand though are these talking heads that make the wildest fucking claims and thats somehow totally ok with their NDA but when they are pressed about facts than they hide behind national security or their NDA or whatever. it just doesnt check out. im also triggered by hardcore cult like believers who think that everyone who is pro ufo is legit and totally honest and that every pixel in the sky is more likely an alien spaceship than a balloon. extremist positions (on both ends of the spectrum) are never healthy i also think that people like mick west or john greenwald are a thousand times more valuable for this topic than all these elizondo clones that really contribute nothing tangible at all

> Your comment really pre-supposes that there are NHI behind all of this I said “IF there’s something to find” I humor all the reasons I’ve seen here that people have given as to why Grusch testified and no matter your belief on what “it” is. Whatever your belief is on this topic and what’s going on with the US government, we need an investigation into Grusch’s claims because; A) He’s telling the truth, we have Craft/bodies/NHI technology. B) He’s been fed false information and yet believes what he’s saying, who is feeding him believable false information and why? C) He’s knows what he’s saying about NHI is false, why would he blatantly lie to Congress, ICIG and the Senate Intelligence Community D) He’s a con man, why would someone with Grusch’s background con everyone? What’s his motivation. Each one of these is concerning and deserves to be investigated, especially when it comes from someone, like Grusch, who was very recently high up and trusted within the US intelligence community.

They literally flew him out to be on their monetized podcast. You think he did that for free?

He absolutely must love it because he's happy in this video and willing to keep exposing himself to it. I don't think people call Bill Nye and NDT out if they feel they're threatened. Show me where his behavior aligns with what you claim. Show me. My claims aren't snide, they're in defense of real people with real claims and real risk.

The only sure way to know the full story is if he tells it to us. His demise could be in the works right now; he could turn up "suicided" tomorrow just for saying what he's said already. Nobody would bat an eye and he'd be out of the news cycle in 2 weeks. The only way out of this is exposure ASAP. Legally or otherwise. I don't trust all the secret agencies and DOD to voluntarily tell us the truth... do you?

If that's how you view it, then you should accept that either he has nothing to say or we will never know the truth.

I mean.... nothing personally against him. But Snowden did the right thing, and so did Assange and so did Manning. Exposing the truth takes risk. Grusch knows this as a former intelligence officer. If he were ordered to extract intelligence for the service of America that could be risking his life. Accordingly, releasing information for the service of humanity also takes risk. If his claims are true, the scope and impact of those revelations would be beyond even legal considerations. Snowden exposed crimes and deserves to be exonerated. So would Grusch.

You might not know this, due to the aforementioned terrible reporting, but that 64 page amendment isn’t just about mandating the declassification of records. It asserts eminent domain over all found UFO technology in the hands of private industry. It mentions “non-human intelligence” more than 20 times, along with “technologies of unknown origin” related to UFOs. Other stuff as well. Rubio’ statements are secondhand information about secret UFO programs. They are, however, his firsthand account that “many” high-ranking officials are testifying to exactly the same thing that Grusch is, with firsthand knowledge or involvement in these programs. So unless you think that Rubio is completely making that up, or has some type of split personality)which don’t seem like particularly strong arguments to me), why then are all these high-level people saying the same things as Grusch, especially given the context of that proposed law which also reflects his claims, in addition to a similar suggestion made by Kirstin Gillibrand ? I’ve seen a lot if hand waving on this in an attempt to ignore it all. I’d invite you to try and actually explain that. Especially without referring to a conspiracy. https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/uap_amendment.pdf Edit: also, no the reason the process is going forward is because the IG determined his claim of UFO program hidden from Congress “credible and urgent” (not just his reprisal complaint like some people are falsely asserting), after which he forwarded it to Congress. The IG job is to investigate and process evidence. **Evidence**.

I love this one. Are you familiar with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer? Democrat? Old guy, wears glasses? He Qanon now all the sudden? That’s what you’re saying? Please explain. Because he’s the main sponsor of a bill that mentions “non-human intelligence” more than 20 times, along with “technologies of unknown origin” related to UFOs. There’s a number of bipartisan cosponsors as well. So there’s that. Incidentally, Marco Rubio is one of the most moderate Republicans out there. Kirstin Gillibrand has suggested something similar as well.

I have always believed that there is stuff out there in the Universe besides humans, so for me Aliens definitely exist. The question is whether or not they are here on Earth, or have been at some point. I don’t think we as humanity can really know what the chances of that are, because we are only just learning about the universe. 10,000 years from now when Humanity is more advanced, we might find life all over the place! Or discover how rare it really is. I just think it is too soon to say that we know what the odds are.

Yes.

Said the random redditor who didn't even bother to watch the video, lol. Give me a freaking break.

Well now you’re just going on a tangent so I think this discussion has come to an end.

No that book doesn't credit Fravor and it isn't written by Fravor so you can fuck right off until you can prove he was paid.

I got that and said it myself regarding that section not supporting OP's positive claim. The part that we disagree about is that you highlighted the word may which implies a positive claim of your own that the word 'may' is undermining a factual statement by introducing uncertainty in the fact being discussed. That positive claim about the use of the word may is incorrect since the word may is discussing control, not the existence of NHI, technology and UAPs which it states elsewhere in the document they have heard credible testimony that they believe.

Can you name anything in the laundry list that doesn't fall under equipment that is defying current levels of material science knowledge and biologics of NHI origins? I think what you are reading as a laundry list is just them being clear that they are not talking about UFOs that are temporarily unidentified, but UAPs that are genuinely anomalous to our current understanding of science and engineering in the modern world.

Considering Grusch helped write the language with Chris Mellon, as well as the whistleblower provisions which he himself employed, I think they know exactly what they intended to imply. Sen Rubio was more than clear in his interviews as to what they were thinking in response to the testimony. Check Lockheed’s basement. Entirely missed the point. And yes, I’ve authored legislation.

Are UFOs real? Yes or no.

It's right here in this topic and all over the sub. You can't even theorize about the stuff without people being like "oH yOu BeLeIvE iN bIgFoOt?" Like, these are theories the people that brought us to this sub are saying, not me. Lue, Valee, hitchinson, corbell, knapp, J Mack, Nolan ext. I'm sorry that your idols went into the woo, but they did, so here we are. Nuts and bolts is over, and people in this sub need to cope.

Did you miss the part about how solar isn't feasible in every part of the world yet?

You realise what modern hydro dams do, right?

If a thing turns, you can use it to make electricity. We've been using them for thousands of years, but have only understood electricity for a couple hundred. Some of the first electric generation was windmills and dams.

That's a terrible understanding of how that works.

Exactly. These people are delusional. But I mean this sub is full of delusional people so no surprise there.

*Archimedes appears, sets some boats on fire, and vanishes*

In what way have we not mastered solar power?

While ridiculous, the arguments about power are still less silly than a revolution without mass-produced steel - which also requires coal.

Wtf? I have no idea what our tech progression would look like if fossil fuels didn't exist. Maybe hydro-based power is enough to progress society until nuclear fission is discovered. I can only imagine. But here's what I know. On a technical level, our civilization ready to transfer ourselves away from fossil fuels decades earlier than we are. We were just too stupid as a society to choose to do that.

They actually have a very hard time with re-forestation because the soil has eroded away without the vegetation to hold it in place, and the ecology that sustains the trees (soil microbes, fungi, plant-animal interactions, etc) is no longer present. So no they can’t simply plant more trees. If you read my comment I am clearly not advocating for the continued use of fossil fuels indefinitely until we exhaust them from the ground. Those of us with the resources (made possible due to the initial energy density and economics of fossil fuels) need to reach the next step of the ladder. But for those burning wood to stay alive every day fossil fuels are their next temporary answer and would objectively cause less environmental destruction in those circumstances

Sure, but a wood-burning based economy has a certain carrying capacity in terms of tree regeneration, which is at the same time being pushed to the limit by modern consumer goods, medicine, etc coming in from outside of these countries. So it's basically a recipe for resource depletion and ecological collapse to continue burning wood for energy today, the population is under too much pressure to expand past the point of where it can be sustained.

We don’t have a small number of humans, we have billions. And millions in the places I am referring to for which wood is not a sustainable solution. Google image the border of Haiti and the DR for reference, or read about the deforestation of Madagascar and parts of Africa for charcoal.

Every economic system humans adopt is a product of our natural evolution, from tribal living to communism and capitalism. Debating what's 'natural' versus what's 'imposed' isn't going to go anywhere, especially with me. Yet, it's undeniable that certain systems, particularly capitalism, have surpassed others in their ability to rapidly distribute wealth, alleviate poverty, and fuel innovation. This very prowess led it to supersede feudalism, which in turn had replaced the hunter-gatherer systems. However, this evolution has brought significant environmental repercussions and other unforeseen consequences. Perhaps one day we'll conclude that we've achieved enough and nature will continue to evolve a new economic system. But I'm not holding my breath.

There has never been communal living “without hierarchy”. Hierarchy has always existed, everywhere. Just because you don’t have a king doesn’t mean there’s no hierarchy.

And why did Europeans have the power to go to every corner of the planet?

You're too deep in the rabbit hole for me to make sense of half of what you're saying. Maybe pop your head out, get some fresh air, eat some grass?

No I don't understand why you say the post is a 'libertarian rant'. Nothing in there suggests to me libertarianism. It's subject is about greed and speculation where it comes from. I understand even less about your last sentence but that part seems off-topic anyway.

If you had the chance to ask a government agent in private why they don't disclose the information about NHI to the public, they would also probably say "people aren't ready". I guess you don't blame them for it as that's exactly what you're doing.

Hey dm me whatever you got I'm curious

I am both ready and VERY interested. Would you DM me, please? I disagree with you about the nature of the 'baggage,' by the way. I think Grusch was referring to whatever inspired Elizondo's use of the word 'sombre.' I think this, in part, because of the way he said it - as much as to say, 'as you know, there's *also* some baggage with this...' But I cld be wrong, and your data may attest to that.

Lmfao this sub really is a caricature of everything wrong with UFO people

Time will tell. I’m patient.

Lol we’re worrying about ET discrimination now? You’re weird.

This is exactly the kind of attitude that prompted the flood. I pray you come to see God’s artistry in this amazing Universe of ours.

It’s not my “way out of it.” ETs are on the table for me and do not affect my faith. The truth is, I simply see demonic activity as being more likely.

You are intellectually inferior to me.

Lol, the famous use of Astral Projection. you know that x-files is a fictional show not a documentary, right? That's why the UFO subject is so hard to study. You always meet idiotic stuff like this amongst the serious and rigorous studies

Speculators will say he hasn't provided any evidence, if I'm wrong someone can show me the evidence that he provided. From what I gather he has mostly second hand knowledge without seeing almost anything personally. It's easy to dismiss it as nothing until he provides something more meaningful.

Reddit moment 🤓 ☝🏾

I'm not trying to convince you of anything, nor am I especially religious - I'm describing the subjective experience of someone who's adherent to a religion and how fervently they already believe in a non-human intelligence.

Got any evidence that I don’t do that already?

Okay buddy if you say so 🥰👍🏼🤭

The ICIG **has been provided** with the list of the 40 names and is the process of conducting their investigation. David Grusch has provided (or will provide) the list to the Congressional Oversight Committee. He doesn’t present evidence to *you* or to me to YouTube. He presents it to *the proper authorities*. What part of this is so hard for you to understand??? Honestly???

There's no winning with these people. Conspiratorial thinking is such a severe derangement they can't be talked out of it. It's so *fucking annoying*. Obviously aliens exist. Obviously it's possible they've visited. But *no one* in this fucking abysmal subreddit can just provide actual evidence or even have a non-hostile conversation about it.

Yeah fair enough, I myself am very much in the ‘see to (fully) believe’ camp. I’m just willing to give these guys the benefit of the doubt while there is still lots happening in the political sphere. If in 12 months, with the passing of the NDAA and other pressures currently building up, we still have nothing to show for his claims then I’ll be right there with you.

Show me the evidence bro!

I’m done arguing with you. When the ICIG’s investigation is completed, I hope you’ll remember how you treated Grusch. Good day!

Yeah true, but now WE would remember, and the next time UFO stuff comes up it would be another point in a growing list of suspicious points. I tend to agree with you, I don’t expect the secret keepers to suddenly spill all their secrets. But I don’t expect anyone to become a martyr for the UFO Disclosure when 99% of the world think it’s all fake. I know I wouldn’t risk my life just for random commentators on Reddit to call me crazy.

If that's how you view it, that's completely reductive to the processes of legal whistleblowing and ignorant, but okay, we'll have to agree to disagree.

There's a huge difference between an intelligence officer engaging in intelligence work for their own country, and breaking his oath by whistleblowing against his own country which comes with direct threats to his family and life. Unfortunately only his reputation could be exonerated if he is killed because of leaking things of this magnitude.

I spent the 15 minutes pursuing that amendment and it is a transparency amendment - creating a catalog of possible artifacts from a multitude of sources. Something of note is the amendment does not preclude the classification of artifacts. Rubio's comments are still hearsay. He said, she said. No first hand info beyond that. As a Floridian, Rubio is not a strong character reference. I am not sure how familiar you are with an IG, but they don't process evidence in the way people believe. They gather data about the issue at hand. Based on that evidence, they get involved. In this situation, the IG seems to believe there is an issue and they want the claims to go forward. Do they have insight into the artifacts? No.

You can totally believe :) But you cannot claim. That us why scientists avoid stating chances when we do not know. But scientists can say for sure that here is no aliens to study here on earth. They would lo, but there is none. So currently consesus is that we are not visited. Until proof is shown that can be studies.

lmao I watched the interview, so cope. How you can believe blindly in a literal information warfare specialist who says stuff in interviews like 'Well, I could tell you more, but I wont because it's not my job teehee' is beyond naive and gullible to me. He's backed up nothing, has an extremely sketchy background that inspires zero confidence in his ability to tell the truth, and is actively working within the framework of an organization that's routinely lied and committed atrocities against it's own people. But yeah, they're TOTALLY going to investigate and snitch on themselves, right? This time for realsies!

I'm on a UFO sub, nothing will convince you guys. 2 more weeks until the ayyys are revealed, friends

Im not talking about fravor. Read what I actually said.I was interested by fravor. But now it's all ppl making money, taking zero actual info, pretending to know on podcasts, books, interviews. Saying nothing actually valuable.Read what I said. I posted the book asked for.

You're arguing against yourself here. OP made an unsubstantiated statement, and I did my best to highlight the closest language that I could guess OP is beelining on (if, in fact, they actually read it at all). Saying that the text I quoted doesn't support the claim that there is no positive statement of existence is silly, since it is patently incorrect. I bolded "may" to try to highlight for OP where they may have been misreading, but because I was making the claim you keep saying I did (which I didn't; quote back otherwise). (If, for example, "may" was "are", the language would still be ambiguous as to existence, but it would be a more reasonable interpretation by OP. "May" makes it abundantly clear that there is no hard statement of existence unintentionally buried in these clauses. Chat with anyone who drafts bills and you'll understand why I highlighted this portion.)

Again, the point here is that they are listing everything that could conceivably be relevant, not that they are making an existence statement for any given item.

Wait, so we've gone from "it definitely says that" to "imply"? Ok... Lol. And give me a break on Rubio. He has been extremely circumspect. Feel free to quote if you think he *knows* that NHI exist, which is the only way he could be part of "disclosure". And Grusch helping write this is neither here nor there, since the strong claim here is that the Senate is disclosing via this draft bill (disclosing something that they supposedly are in the dark on, to boot, to complete the nonsensical circularity).

Well, UFO's are observed nearly daily in aviation around the world. Like something in the corner of your eye. Is it a fruit fly? A regular fly? Maybe a mosquito? Just a glare? You can't tell for sure. So it remains unidentified. What it isn't, is an extraterrestrial life form in a flying saucer. Aliens remain in our culture like a sasquatch or the chubacabra. In a more and more atheistic world, they are replacing gods as a make-belief filler of void. So, yes.

Obviously not, that was my whole point.

We had those thousands of years ago? There’s a good reason the Industrial Revolution was powered by coal and it’s a stupid argument to say that it could have just as easily been solar/hydro/wind powered when we can’t master solar power today with all of our resources and infrastructure.

I’m just not sure we would be able to get those things without the initial push from fossil fuels and coal. You people really don’t seem to think steel is as important as I do to development.

Why aren't the mods banning people that clearly don't have an interest in this topic and just pop in to leave shitty, quippy personal insults to the userbase? *Oh yeah that's bc they're compromised too*

We can’t make steel with solar power. We can’t run our cities off of 100% solar power. We can run whole cities and trains off of coal. If you wanted to you could make a coal powered car. It wouldn’t be a good car, but it could be done. A solar powered car (not one that runs on a charged battery) still hasn’t been made afaik. https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/gm-coal-powered-turbine-chrysler-leno-ecojet/

Sure I agree, but that’s not what we’re talking about. We’re talking about if our society nuked itself and another species rose from the ashes, could it become advanced without coal and fossil fuels.

I don't necessarily disagree with anything in your comment. It is a complex issue and I am biased as I am more used to looking at things on a geologic timescale, not human timeframes. I also agree with things like the Paris agreement having different targets for developing nations vs developed. It isn't fair to pull the ladder up after industrialised nations have reaped their benefits.

The trouble is is that if you make fossil fuels readily available to a group that’s using wood as a fuel you’ll start to have a Jevon’s Paradox type thing going on. They’ll keep on using the wood and find ways of using the fossil fuels for things like running a generator so they can power AC or a fridge. It’s human nature.

One of the parent comments was talking about scenarios after a great reset and decimation of human civilization. I presumed you were following the thread of the conversation, not talking about switching today's 8 billion people to wood based living.

[deleted]

That's not true, I sincerely believe that we *are* ready to hear the truth.

Forward me please lmao

If by ‘data’ you mean another crackpot with a theory…

Yeah, your post is a pretty good example of everything that's wrong with this sub.

You'll be dead before you are vindicated

Nah. You're going to end up like Jimmy Carter, who, when told that Earth was seeded by NHI, cried like a baby. You people are pathetic.

I’m just not tryna make enemies with what we don’t understand do you not see my perspective at all?

And your attitude is why the Church as an institution is dying. People are fleeing the faith in droves because they realize it's a mechanism to keep us under control and stupid. You're no exception.

The famous flood lmao

I pray you come to see the beauty inherent in everything doesn't need to imply a great big man-baby in the sky playing with 3d crayons.

We’re thinking animals that can make advanced tools and have complex civilization so it’s really not that big of a jump from that to, well maybe other thinking animals with advanced technology and civilization exist. But you need to Olympian leap to get to it being demons that drive mechanical vehicles(which is odd as spiritual beings, why do they need vehicles? But things like us need vehicles) At the end of the day I’m happy for the religious to rationalize it whatever way they want if it assuages concerns about ontological shock. We can clearly handle it and theological worldviews have rationalized stuff like this before and it will be no different this time

I would gladly take that bet I have a head start since I am not a religious moron believing in fairy tales

> you know that x-files is a fictional show not a documentary, right? This really might be the crux here. Some people have genuinely forgotten what the "fi" in sci-fi means. If they ever even knew.

The CIA did studies on it

You’re right in everything you say. It’s all second hand information and he has confirmed that in his ‘testimony’.

Grow up 🤓 ☝🏾

And I say that subjective belief don’t have a place in these discussions. People believe in all kind of BS. The very fact that the majority of world population is more or less religious is already depressing in itself considering how debunked religion has been for a while. It’s even more depressing when fairy tales are associated with some degrees of « knowledge » That’s why ufology is a joke, it’s full of people who have zero clue on what qualifies as knowledge

>The ICIG has been provided with the list of the 40 names and is the process of conducting their investigation. Providing a list of names doesn't mean jack shit guy. You're really jumping the gun here. You can come back and call me stupid AFTER we have some results from an investigation going "Holy shit, this guy was actually telling the truth". But trying to do that at the START of an investigation is just mind-blowingly stupid. "They are looking into it, THEREFORE EVERYTHING HE SAYS IS TRUE!" is not how it works. >He doesn’t present evidence to you or to me to YouTube. He presents it to the proper authorities. Then that doesn't really mean much for the general public when they have to make a judgement call about whether something is true or not, does it? You are pretty much going "No, I don't have evidence. I haven't seen any evidence. But this one guy claims to have evidence! And he totally gave that evidence to someone else, who has yet to confirm any sort of findings! Therefore I believe everything." You're the one who is not understanding. An investigation is not evidence. A guy saying he has evidence is not evidence. For belief, I need evidence. There is none.

Yeah, it's like talking to a brick wall. Hell, I don't even think aliens are that unlikely out there in the universe. I just want evidence before I go believing in something. Apparently "Some dude said so!" is good enough for that guy though lol.

ok misses high iq

Watch the video, brah. They show him being flown in by the podcast. Again - this is evidence it was paid. Do you think Grusch can just go around talking to everyone IN-PERSON for free?

I accept your concession and inability to defend him, now that you've considered how careless he is acting. I hope you hold him accountable for his current egregious behavior. Remember: I am holding him to his claims. You are deifying him without evidence.

Cope

Stop making claims to try and troll me.

So we just sit in ignorance on the most important discovery of the century, maybe the millennium, because... rules and protocols? Is that it? Somehow the laws of one nation should be held higher than the exposure of truth? If this is how people are approaching the problem, then Grusch really is a dead end. We will never know anything going down this route.

I could address those contortions, but I’d like to point out that you didn’t try to explain it, which is what I was expecting. And if you’re not going to try to explain why things are happening the way they are, specifically, you should just say so. Because it seems like you should at least admit to yourself that that means you are not in a strong position to make a good argument. Unless you think it does somehow, which I again invite you to explain.

Well I can claim a little bit. There is life on earth, therefore it is likely there is life on other planets. David Grusch had made the claim that there is alien life on this planet, so why are so many people against investigating it? It seems very anti-science to simply say ‘he is wrong and crazy’. He might be, but let’s check his work first to find out. Let us investigate to find out if there is proof, before we dismiss everything. In my opinion anyway!

Lol, he's got more credibility than a random redditor like you will EVER have, his credentials and background have been verified by Congress FFS.

Yes, maybe it’s not a good idea to go on a sub about something you clearly know nothing about.

Still, not written by Grusch and no connection to Grusch other than the topic. Which at this point any member of the public could do. The guy who just went from making anywhere from 80 to 180k in his 16 year intelligence position isn't selling or writing that garbage book you posted. You don't have any proof so you can just move on. It's fine if you're saying he 'going to' do that. That's fair but don't make up a bunch of incredulous bullshit and act like it's a fact.
