Good God, have we gone downhill. Fanaticism is rampant now on both sides. Both sides are okay with their leadership doing evil things because you have to fight evil with evil. Everything is catch phrases now, alot of it is based on irrational thought. There's so many people that clearly have no idea what's actually going on, and we try to blame these people, but both sides own the news and all the media. Our government doesn't understand why the people don't trust them, but they're the cause. There's 2 big narratives going around, and I'm sure the truth is somewhere in there, but this situation is a result of bad leadership and rampant corruption on both sides. The real big gutshot was watching the democratic party fuck over Sanders in 2016 elections. I felt that he genuinely wanted to help the country."

More so, each party acknowledging their responsibility is what's key to a solution, not just identifying the others. \n\nThink of it this way:\n\nA bully feels like the person he's bullying is acting in a way that deserves it. Not that he's being this asshole bully. And what do we know about bullies? That aggression is coming from an internal lack of confidence, or whatever it may be, And it's only challenging it that gets them to stop, continually acquiescing to them only makes it worse. Somebody getting bullied day in and day out that just keeps letting it happen eventually shares in the responsibility, but in a much smaller way. And establishing that the bully is the responsible one is not going to suddenly change the situation, The guy getting bullied taking responsibility for what he can do will.  \n\nIn the same way, both parties can do relatively small things that elicit much larger reactions on the other side. And that's because the two parties, and every single individual, have different values and priorities. One thing the both parties do, and have always done, is react to other party like it's going to be the death of everyone and everything. And that just emboldens the other side. \n\nAnd what do we know about the Republican party? They are reactionary. They have little to no platform of their own. Making things easy for them to react to is just as much the left's responsibility as it is the rights for overreacting to it."
