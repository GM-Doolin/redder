            "body": "I'm building an AI-powered Executive Assistant and I named it Jarvis. Personally, I only find ChatGPT/Bard to be useful for information retrieval but can't do anything for me, compared to what a human assistant can do.\n\nSo I built one. Current features I included full integration with Google Calendar and Todoist, morning brief and mid-day check-in, personality, memory, and habit tracking.\n\nI'm not trying to promote the product but want to see how people will use it and whether people will like it. The product itself is 100% free and no ads whatsoever.\n\nWill this be something you are interested in? I'm offering a 30-min session to onboard a small set of test users if you think Jarvis could be useful to you. Reply or dm.\n\nHope this won't break the Self-promotion rule as members in this community share the same interests!",
