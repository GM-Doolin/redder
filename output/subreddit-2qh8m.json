According to the Stoic, virtue is the sole good and virtue is itself sufficient for happiness. We have plenty of systems that guide people to be ethical.

Beyond the amazing technological changes that are just around the corner, that is probably how AIs will help us the most.\n\nIf a belief in god isn't itself enough to make people behave themselves, if rational self interest seemingly can't compel us to make healthy choices, what makes you think some silicon wafers with a friendly disposition is going to do the trick? Because magic? \n\nTo quote Dostoevsky's grand inquisitor, \"Man was created a rebel; and how can rebels be happy?\" Maybe ~~the messiah~~ ASI will allow us \"to think of the happiness of men.\".
