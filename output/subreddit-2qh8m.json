            "body": " A ChatGPT prompt is a phrase or instruction you give the ChatGPT AI model to generate a response. Prompts can be anything from a question, statement, or other words intended to spark creativity, \u201cthought,\u201d or engagement.\n\nI have been following ChatGPT Prompts since January and have noticed that the format of prompts is becoming increasingly complex. For example, it used to be just a simple prompt like \"Act as...\" with only 30 to 50 words. But now, almost all descriptions are very detailed, consisting of at least 200 words that can generate images, tables, PPTs, and so on. The role of reminder engineers has also emerged as a profession.  \n\n\nSo far, several websites have gained popularity online, including Character.ai, FlowGPT, POE, JasperAI, and Writesonic.\n\nI would like to discuss with everyone the future of prompts. Can they really replace many professionals? Recently, I came across Google sponsoring FlowGPT's Hackathon event, which is similar to various themed competitions involving prompts. I am curious about their evaluation criteria and why they would spend $10,000 to hold such an event. **Are these competitions just marketing scams\uff1f**\n\n[**Hackathon Website**](https://flowgpt.com/bounty)  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1li4erbo0apb1.png?width=1276&format=png&auto=webp&s=387121c6e6ea761513ad30bd96d899e6f4f60fe8",

It is a computer program first and foremost, so in order to get it to output its best work, you have to understand how to speak the best input. The better you understand the material you are discussing with it or tasking it with, the better it will respond to you. Very vague, ambiguous, and large ideas have a tendency to throw it off.  Point in case, using the word \"beauty\" or \"beautiful.\"  It will lose itself in its own tokens validating the fact that something is subjective.  It will find computer language more beautiful than the idea of beauty.  \n\nHeavily nuanced subjects that humans can piece together or conceptualize are not necessarily its strongest attributes.  Take, for instance, music.  I've used Google's MusicLM through their test kitchen. While it's great, some things do not output a response from it.  Niche genres are things you have to walk these through.  Same with LLM's."

While many are technically employed, you also have millions that have just dropped out of the workforce entirely, and you have millions more than work several part-time jobs and still don't make enough to disqualify themselves for SNAP. \n\nUBI doesn't exist in the US, but 41.2 million people in the US get SNAP benefits. When the US starts siphoning huge amounts of taxes from the tech giants that become tech super-giants, a genuine UBI shouldn't be too difficult to implement.\n\nOf course... politicians that are getting huge kickbacks for promises of keeping corporate taxes low will just continue to yell \"SOCIALISM\" and millions of the broke and unemployed will swallow it. So even if unemployment was closer to 25%, I believe a certain 70 million or so Americans will continue to vote against their own survival."

AI may not create more natural resources, but eventually should lead to better extraction of resources, better energy output from those resources, better uses for those resources, hopefully the ability to find alternatives to current resources that are more abundant, and better distribution of resources. This is on top of many other potential benefits like increasing access to high quality, customized education, increased understanding of psychological issues, better medicine, and all types of stuff. It\u2019s also going to cause a significant shift in labor, and likely will result in massive wealth disparity, for some time at least. Hopefully the wealth disparity and potential incredible hardships that follow for the majority of the population will be temporary, and within a lifetime or 10, or hopefully less, restructure society in a way that is more beneficial for everyone."
